Due to the effective approach, modifications of the algebra of constraints generically lead to anomalies. In order to remove those anomalies, counter terms are introduced. We find a way to explicitly fulfill the conditions for anomaly freedom and we give explicit expressions for the counter terms. Surprisingly, the -scheme naturally arises in this procedure. The gauge-invariant variables are found and equations of motion for the anomaly-free scalar perturbations are derived. Finally, some cosmological consequences are discussed qualitatively.",Physics,0,0,holonomy correction scalar perturbation investigated loop quantum cosmology framework due effective approach modification algebra constraint generically lead anomaly order remove anomaly counter term introduced find way explicitly fulfill condition anomaly freedom give explicit expression counter term surprisingly scheme naturally arises procedure gaugeinvariant variable found equation motion anomalyfree scalar perturbation derived finally cosmological consequence discussed qualitatively

The role of positive curvature is negligible at late times, but can be crucial in the early universe.

These cosmologies have no singularity, no 'beginning of time' and no horizon problem.

Si le temps etait circulaire, les rituels de renouvellement du monde seraient superflus, car ce renouveau se ferait de toute facon, avec ou sans les rituels. Ainsi, la construction de ce scenario n'explique en rien cette pratique rituelle. Les anthropologues aiment attribuer des metaphysiques non-standard a l'Autre et affirmer qu'il vit dans une realite socialement construite de facon completement differente. Prolongeant ce relativisme culturel, la these que les differentes cultures vivent dans des cadres temporels differents, peut etre qualifiee de relativisme culturel temporel.

He 2-428 and M 1-91 have high density (from 10 3.3 to 10 6.5 cm -3 ) unresolved nebular cores that indicate that strong mass loss/exchange phenomena are occurring close to their central stars. An F0 star is found at the centre of symmetry of A 79; its reddening and distance are consistent with the association of the star with the nebula. The spectrum of the core of He 2-428 shows indications of the presence of a hot star with red excess emission, probably arising in a late-type companion.

Four classes of LDPC codes are constructed based on the lines and points of Euclidean and projective geometries over finite fields. Codes of these four classes have good minimum distances and their Tanner (1981) graphs have girth 6. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be decoded in various ways, ranging from low to high decoding complexity and from reasonably good to very good performance. They perform very well with iterative decoding. Furthermore, they can be put in either cyclic or quasi-cyclic form. Consequently, their encoding can be achieved in linear time and implemented with simple feedback shift registers. This advantage is not shared by other LDPC codes in general and is important in practice. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be extended and shortened in various ways to obtain other good LDPC codes. Several techniques of extension and shortening are presented. Long extended finite-geometry LDPC codes have been constructed and they achieve a performance only a few tenths of a decibel away from the Shannon theoretical limit with iterative decoding.",Mathematics;Computer Science,0,0,paper present geometric approach construction lowdensity paritycheck ldpc code four class ldpc code constructed based line point euclidean projective geometry finite field code four class good minimum distance tanner graph girth finitegeometry ldpc code decoded various way ranging low high decoding complexity reasonably good good performance perform well iterative decoding furthermore put either cyclic quasicyclic form consequently encoding achieved linear time implemented simple feedback shift register advantage shared ldpc code general important practice finitegeometry ldpc code extended shortened various way obtain good ldpc code several technique extension shortening presented long extended finitegeometry ldpc code constructed achieve performance tenth decibel away shannon theoretical limit iterative decoding

The puzzling darkness of massive Milky Way subhaloes,"ABSTRACT We show that dissipationless CDM simulations predict that the majority of themost massive subhalos of the Milky Way are too dense to host any of its brightsatellites (L V > 10 5 L ). These dark subhalos have circular velocities at infall ofV infall = 30 1070kms 1 and infall masses of [0:2 4] 10 M . Unless the Milky Way isa statistical anomaly, this implies that galaxy formation becomes e ectively stochasticat these masses. This is in marked contrast to the well-established monotonic relationbetween galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massivehalos. We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhalosare expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation ux than Draco. It maybe possible to circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites ordi erent dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhalos byorder unity on a scale of 0.3 { 1 kpc.Key words: Galaxy: halo { galaxies: abundances { dark matter { cosmology: theory",Physics,0,0,abstract show dissipationless cdm simulation predict majority themost massive subhalos milky way dense host brightsatellites l v l dark subhalos circular velocity infall ofv infall km infall mass unless milky way isa statistical anomaly implies galaxy formation becomes e ectively stochasticat mass marked contrast wellestablished monotonic relationbetween galaxy luminosity halo circular velocity halo mass massivehalos show least two typically four massive dark subhalosare expected produce larger dark matter annihilation ux draco maybe possible circumvent conclusion baryonic feedback dwarf satellite ordi erent dark matter physic reduce central density massive subhalos byorder unity scale kpckey word galaxy halo galaxy abundance dark matter cosmology theory

(GCC) GCCA/GCCATGG emerges as the consensus sequence for initiation of translation in vertebrates. The most highly conserved position in that motif is the purine in position -3 (three nucleotides upstream from the ATG codon); 97% of vertebrate mRNAs have a purine, most often A, in that position. The periodical occurrence of G (in positions -3, -6, -9) is discussed. Upstream ATG codons occur in fewer than 10% of vertebrate mRNAs-at-large; a notable exception are oncogene transcripts, two-thirds of which have ATG codons preceding the start of the major open reading frame. The leader sequences of most vertebrate mRNAs fall in the size range of 20 to 100 nucleotides.

Given that the paradigm has been around for awhile, one would expect a broadly agreed-upon, solid understanding of what autonomous agents are and what they are not. This, however, is not the case. We therefore join the ongoing debate on what are the appropriate notions of autonomous agency. We approach agents and agent ontology from a cybernetics and general systems perspective, in contrast to the much more common in the agent literature sociology, anthropology and/or cognitive psychology based approaches. We attempt to identify the most fundamental attributes of autonomous agents, and propose a tentative hierarchy of autonomous agents based on those attributes.",Computer Science,0,0,autonomous agent become influential powerful paradigm great variety discipline sociology economics distributed artificial intelligence software engineering philosophy given paradigm around awhile one would expect broadly agreedupon solid understanding autonomous agent however case therefore join ongoing debate appropriate notion autonomous agency approach agent agent ontology cybernetics general system perspective contrast much common agent literature sociology anthropology andor cognitive psychology based approach attempt identify fundamental attribute autonomous agent propose tentative hierarchy autonomous agent based attribute

This algorithm runs in (v) O(g) steps where v is the number of vertices of G. We believe that removing the nondiscrete topological definitions (i.e., the notation or differentiability, 2-dimensional surface, etc.) from our formal definitions has a multitude of advantages. First our goal is to produce an algorithm which operates on discrete machines and thus at some point we must remove these notions anyway. Secondly, demonstrations on proofs in the amalgam of graph theory and topology have been riddled with flaws (e.g., 4-color theorem, planarity algorithms, Jordan curve theorem), and which, no doubt, this paper also suffers. The hope is that a combinatorial proof may transcend these problems. Third, our main goal is not just to draw graphs on “inner tubes” but to understand how graph theory, topology and computational complexity interact. We have kept no definitions sacred and we have redefined the notion of a graph. We have even rewritten Euler's formula.",Computer Science,0,0,paper present algorithm input graph g positive integer g find embedding g surface genius g embedding exists algorithm run v og step v number vertex g believe removing nondiscrete topological definition ie notation differentiability dimensional surface etc formal definition multitude advantage first goal produce algorithm operates discrete machine thus point must remove notion anyway secondly demonstration proof amalgam graph theory topology riddled flaw eg color theorem planarity algorithm jordan curve theorem doubt paper also suffers hope combinatorial proof may transcend problem third main goal draw graph inner tube understand graph theory topology computational complexity interact kept definition sacred redefined notion graph even rewritten euler formula

All five galaxies show prominent Mg ii emission and absorption in a P Cygni profile. We find no correlation between the equivalent widths of Mg ii and Lyα emission. The Mg ii emission has a broader range of velocities than do the nebular emission line profiles; the Mg ii emission is redshifted with respect to systemic by 100–200 km s−1. When present, Lyα is even more redshifted. The reddest components of Mg ii and Lyα emission have tails to 500–600 km s−1, implying a strong outflow. The lack of correlation in the Mg ii and Lyα equivalent widths, the differing velocity profiles, and the high ratios of Mg ii to nebular line fluxes together suggest that the bulk of Mg ii emission does not ultimately arise as nebular line emission, but may instead be reprocessed stellar continuum emission.",Physics,0,0,examine mg ii å lyα nebular line emission five bright starforming galaxy z gravitationally lensed foreground galaxy cluster five galaxy show prominent mg ii emission absorption p cygni profile find correlation equivalent width mg ii lyα emission mg ii emission broader range velocity nebular emission line profile mg ii emission redshifted respect systemic km present lyα even redshifted reddest component mg ii lyα emission tail km implying strong outflow lack correlation mg ii lyα equivalent width differing velocity profile high ratio mg ii nebular line flux together suggest bulk mg ii emission ultimately arise nebular line emission may instead reprocessed stellar continuum emission

Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo.

Warm dark matter (WDM) is a simple modification of CDM in which the dark matter particles have initial velocities due either to their having decoupled as thermal relics or to their having been formed via nonequilibrium decay. We investigate the nonlinear gravitational clustering of WDM with a high-resolution N-body code and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative to CDM, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low-mass satellites. The number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by ""top-down"" fragmentation of caustics, as part of a ""cosmic web"" connecting massive halos. Few small halos form outside this web. If we identify small halos with dwarf galaxies, then their number, spatial distribution, and formation epoch appear in better agreement with the observations for WDM than they are for CDM.",Physics,0,0,discrepancy emerged prediction standard cold dark matter cdm theory observation clustering subgalactic scale warm dark matter wdm simple modification cdm dark matter particle initial velocity due either decoupled thermal relic formed via nonequilibrium decay investigate nonlinear gravitational clustering wdm highresolution nbody code identify number distinctive observational signature relative cdm halo concentration core density lowered core radius increased large halo emerge far fewer lowmass satellite number small halo suppressed present formed topdown fragmentation caustic part cosmic web connecting massive halo small halo form outside web identify small halo dwarf galaxy number spatial distribution formation epoch appear better agreement observation wdm cdm

Nebular diagnostic diagrams such as (N ii)/(O ii) and (S ii)/(O ii) versus ((O ii) + (O iii))/Hshow that the H ii regions of the barred galaxy have the same range of physical conditions as found in non-barred late-type galaxies. Extinction is moderately high across the disc and there is evidence for a slight trend of extinction with galactocentric distance; the logarithmic extinction at Hfalls from about c(H�) = 1.2 in the centre to 0.6 - 0.8 in the outer regions. The global O/H distribution has a moderate gradient of � 0.5 dex �0 1 (� 0.02 dex kpc 1 ) consistent with the known trend between the slope of the abundance gradient and the strength of the bar. A break is seen in the O/H gradient just beyond the -4/1 resonance, the gradient being moderately steep at � 0.8 dex � 1 0 (-0.05 dex/kpc) inside this resonance, and flat beyond �/�0 � 0.55.

The oxidizing conditions must have resulted from the complete vaporization of nebular regions with enhanced dust/gas ratios (∼ 10–40 × solar). Because the origin of each of the metal grains studied requires different condensation parameters (dust/gas ratio, isolation degree, and Cr depletion factor), a high degree of heterogeneity in the formation region of the Bencubbin‐like chondrite metal is required. To preserve compositional zoning of the metal grains and prevent their melting and sulfidization, the grains must have been removed from the hot condensation region into cold regions where the accretion of the Bencubbin‐like asteroidal body took place.",Geology,0,0,abstract thermodynamic analysis compositional profile across large chemicallyzoned fe ni metal grain bencubbinlike chondrite queen alexandra range que suggests grain formed nonequilibrium gassolid condensation variable oxidizing condition isolation degree cr depletion factor oxidizing condition must resulted complete vaporization nebular region enhanced dustgas ratio solar origin metal grain studied requires different condensation parameter dustgas ratio isolation degree cr depletion factor high degree heterogeneity formation region bencubbinlike chondrite metal required preserve compositional zoning metal grain prevent melting sulfidization grain must removed hot condensation region cold region accretion bencubbinlike asteroidal body took place

Quoting from this tradition and drawing on the mechanical character of such techniques of animation, nineteenth and twentieth-century authors and filmmakers——Flaubert, Huysmans, and Bunnuel——explore the aesthetic possibilities of these religious practices. Thus, they recover and illustrate a history of the evocation of sensation and emotion through images and texts, which in the medieval context can be best described as a highly formal art of ""praying by numbers.""",History,0,0,essay argue imitation example sainthood practice prayer formal basis medieval aesthetic focus animation phenomenology sensation emotion quoting tradition drawing mechanical character technique animation nineteenth twentiethcentury author filmmakersflaubert huysmans bunnuelexplore aesthetic possibility religious practice thus recover illustrate history evocation sensation emotion image text medieval context best described highly formal art praying number

Approximately 40% of the hydrous particles contain diopside, a probable indicator of parent body thermal metamorphism, while this mineral is rarely present in the anhydrous particles. Based on this evidence, we find that hydrous and anhydrous IDPs are, in general, not directly related, and we conclude that olivine and pyroxene major-element compositions can be used to help discriminate between IDPs that are (1) predominantly nebular condensates, and lately resided in anhydrous or icy (no liquids) primitive parent bodies, and (2) those originating from more geochemically active parent bodies (probably hydrous and anhydrous asteroids).",Geology,0,0,report analysis olivine pyroxene petrofabrics chondritic interplanetary dust particle idp comparing anhydrous hydrous type approximately hydrous particle contain diopside probable indicator parent body thermal metamorphism mineral rarely present anhydrous particle based evidence find hydrous anhydrous idp general directly related conclude olivine pyroxene majorelement composition used help discriminate idp predominantly nebular condensate lately resided anhydrous icy liquid primitive parent body originating geochemically active parent body probably hydrous anhydrous asteroid

Discrete time evolution,"Using general features of recent quantizations of the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology, a dynamical interpretation of the constraint equation as evolution equation is presented. This involves a transformation from the connection to a dreibein representation and the selection of an internal time variable. Due to the discrete nature of geometrical quantities in loop quantum gravity, time also turns out to be discrete leading to a difference rather than differential evolution equation. Furthermore, evolving observables are discussed within this framework, which enables an investigation of physical spectra of geometrical quantities. In particular, the physical volume spectrum is proven to equal the discrete kinematical volume spectrum in loop quantum cosmology.",Physics,0,0,using general feature recent quantization hamiltonian constraint loop quantum gravity loop quantum cosmology dynamical interpretation constraint equation evolution equation presented involves transformation connection dreibein representation selection internal time variable due discrete nature geometrical quantity loop quantum gravity time also turn discrete leading difference rather differential evolution equation furthermore evolving observables discussed within framework enables investigation physical spectrum geometrical quantity particular physical volume spectrum proven equal discrete kinematical volume spectrum loop quantum cosmology

In the far red and near-infrared regions, where there are only few atomic night-sky lines, the OH variation-rotation spectrum may be used for this purpose.

Concepts of joint failure importance (JFI) and marginal failure importance (MFI), duals of JRI and marginal reliability importance (MRI), are also introduced. The JRI of two edges in an undirected network is represented by the MRI of each edge in subnetworks. Relationships between JRI and MRI, JRI and JFI, and JFI and MFI are presented. From these relationships, it is shown that the JRI is an appropriate quantitative measure of the interactions of two edges in a network, with respect to source-to-terminal reliability. It can also show that the sign of the JRI of two edges can be determined without computing the JRI of these two edges in some special cases. >",Mathematics,0,0,joint reliability importance jri two edge undirected network introduced concept joint failure importance jfi marginal failure importance mfi duals jri marginal reliability importance mri also introduced jri two edge undirected network represented mri edge subnetworks relationship jri mri jri jfi jfi mfi presented relationship shown jri appropriate quantitative measure interaction two edge network respect sourcetoterminal reliability also show sign jri two edge determined without computing jri two edge special case

Much is known about his views on particular philosophical and theological problems, and about the historical backgrounds to, and the relations amongst, some of these views.

1479,601c17c18de54f00d415587dceb8abfa30b4203e,Varieties of Philosophical Theology Before and After Kant,"In discussing philosophical theology (PT) before and after Kant there are at least five stories to be considered. They all start with the theistic project, i.e. natural and rational theology as purely philosophical accounts of God based on grounds independent of Christian theology and the traditions of faith. They all run into the fundamental crises of philosophical theism in the wake of Hume and Kant. Critical PT (CPT) is Kant's constructive alternative to DPT after the collapse of natural and rational theology. In many versions, PT has been practised as the mistaken attempt to provide religious orientation itself, a better, more comprehensive, more rational, better justified orientation than a particular religious tradition of lived and practised communal faith is allegedly supposed to do. That is true of the foundationalist versions of philosophical theism (DPT), subjective transcendentalism (IPT), realist panentheism (RPT) as well as the directive versions of philosophy of religion.

Usually, a roughness penalty is imposed on the solution. The difficulty is to avoid the smoothing of edges, which are very important attributes of the image. The authors first give sufficient conditions for the design of such an edge-preserving regularization. Under these conditions, it is possible to introduce an auxiliary variable whose role is twofold. Firstly, it marks the discontinuities and ensures their preservation from smoothing. Secondly, it makes the criterion half-quadratic. The optimization is then easier. The authors propose a deterministic strategy, based on alternate minimizations on the image and the auxiliary variable. This yields two algorithms, ARTUR and LEGEND. The authors apply these algorithms to the problem of SPECT reconstruction.<<ETX>>",Computer Science,0,0,many image processing problem illposed must regularized usually roughness penalty imposed solution difficulty avoid smoothing edge important attribute image author first give sufficient condition design edgepreserving regularization condition possible introduce auxiliary variable whose role twofold firstly mark discontinuity ensures preservation smoothing secondly make criterion halfquadratic optimization easier author propose deterministic strategy based alternate minimization image auxiliary variable yield two algorithm artur legend author apply algorithm problem spect reconstructionetx

In that case, the optimal allocation characterized by Myerson (1981) cannot be achieved without resale.

In two-bidder cases, I prove that the Myerson allocation can be achieved under standard conditions supplemented with two assumptions. With three or more bidders, achieving the Myerson allocation is more difficult. I prove that it can be implemented in special cases. In those cases, the Myerson allocation is generated through a sequence of resale auctions, each optimally chosen by a reseller.

Unfortunately, many of them are still recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which is a bottleneck for systematic metabolic engineering. To facilitate the genetic manipulation of actinomycetes, we developed a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete gene(s) or gene cluster(s), implement precise gene replacements, and reversibly control gene expression in actinomycetes. We demonstrate our system by targeting two genes, actIORF1 (SCO5087) and actVB (SCO5092), from the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Our CRISPR-Cas9 system successfully inactivated the targeted genes. When no templates for homology-directed repair (HDR) were present, the site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by Cas9 were repaired through the error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in a library of deletions with variable sizes around the targeted sequence. If templates for HDR were provided at the same time, precise deletions of the targeted gene were observed with near 100% frequency. Moreover, we developed a system to efficiently and reversibly control expression of target genes, deemed CRISPRi, based on a catalytically dead variant of Cas9 (dCas9). The CRISPR-Cas9 based system described here comprises a powerful and broadly applicable set of tools to manipulate actinomycetal genomes.",Medicine,0,0,bacteria order actinomycetales one important source pharmacologically active industrially relevant secondary metabolite unfortunately many still recalcitrant genetic manipulation bottleneck systematic metabolic engineering facilitate genetic manipulation actinomycete developed highly efficient crisprcas system delete gene gene cluster implement precise gene replacement reversibly control gene expression actinomycete demonstrate system targeting two gene actiorf sco actvb sco actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster streptomyces coelicolor crisprcas system successfully inactivated targeted gene template homologydirected repair hdr present sitespecific dna doublestrand break dsbs introduced ca repaired errorprone nonhomologous end joining nhej pathway resulting library deletion variable size around targeted sequence template hdr provided time precise deletion targeted gene observed near frequency moreover developed system efficiently reversibly control expression target gene deemed crispri based catalytically dead variant ca dcas crisprcas based system described comprises powerful broadly applicable set tool manipulate actinomycetal genome

The problem, says Jung Young Lee, is not with the doctrine of the Trinity itself; rather, it is with the Western conceptual tendency to view reality in exclusive, ""either/or"" terms. The Trinity is at its heart an inclusive doctrine of one God who is nonetheless three distinct persons. In order to grasp this fact, we need different conceptual categories, not only with which to view God, but all of reality. The Asian philosophical construct of yin and yang can offer a way out of this problem, with its inherently ""both/and"" way of thinking. Drawing on a variety of East Asian religious traditions, Lee offers a creative reinterpretation of this central Christian doctrine. He shows how a global perspective can illuminate Western theological constructs as he establishes the necessity of a contextual approach to the doctrine of the Trinity.",Philosophy,0,0,western christian often despair finding meaning paradoxical statement god one three problem say jung young lee doctrine trinity rather western conceptual tendency view reality exclusive eitheror term trinity heart inclusive doctrine one god nonetheless three distinct person order grasp fact need different conceptual category view god reality asian philosophical construct yin yang offer way problem inherently bothand way thinking drawing variety east asian religious tradition lee offer creative reinterpretation central christian doctrine show global perspective illuminate western theological construct establishes necessity contextual approach doctrine trinity

The RAG tool can generate a design for a Bus Arbiter (BA). The BA is able to handle the exact number of bus masters for both on-chip and off-chip buses.

The first contribution of this paper is the automated generation of a round-robin token passing BA to reduce time spent on arbiter design. The generated arbiter is fair, fast, and has a low and predictable worst-case wait time. The second contribution of this paper is the design and integration of a distributed fast arbiter, e.g., for a terabit switch, based on 2/spl times/2 and 4/spl times/4 switch arbiters (SAs). Using a .25/spl mu/ TSMC standard cell library from LEDA Systems [10, 14], we show the arbitration time of a 256/spl times/256 SA for a terabit switch and demonstrate that the SA generated by RAG meets the time constraint to achieve approximately six terabits of throughput in a typical network switch design.

We further prove that stationary solutions do not exist if the black hole parameters satisfy the Hawking–Reall bound and a−Λ<320 . We conclude with the statement of mode stability which preludes boundedness and decay estimates for general solutions which will be proven in a separate paper. Our boundary conditions are the standard ones which follow from fixing the conformal class of the metric at infinity and lead to a coupling of the two Teukolsky equations. The proof relies on combining the Teukolsky–Starobinsky identities with the coupled boundary conditions. In the stationary case the proof exploits elliptic estimates which fail if the Hawking–Reall bound is violated. This is consistent with the superradiant instabilities expected in that regime.",Physics;Mathematics,0,0,prove nonstationary respect hawking vectorfield real mode solution teukolsky equation dimensional subextremal kerrantide sitter spacetimes prove stationary solution exist black hole parameter satisfy hawkingreall bound aλ conclude statement mode stability prelude boundedness decay estimate general solution proven separate paper boundary condition standard one follow fixing conformal class metric infinity lead coupling two teukolsky equation proof relies combining teukolskystarobinsky identity coupled boundary condition stationary case proof exploit elliptic estimate fail hawkingreall bound violated consistent superradiant instability expected regime

Thus, it does not help us for a nosological classification which must also allow for the prognosis. In order to make a prognostic distinction we have to subdivide the schizo-affective psychoses into the 'cycloid psychoses' and the 'non-systematic schizophrenias'. Also the latter display affective symptoms and can take a bipolar course, but, despite this, tend to deterioration; they do so increasingly shift after shift, whereas the cycloid psychoses completely recover after every phase. Even during the first phase or shift a reliable differential diagnosis can be made. This has been confirmed by follow-up examinations, as the cycloid psychotics, in fact, had recovered. Only very few misdiagnoses could be detected.

However, current SDN compilers are closely bound to both languages and rules, thus disable the interoperability and compatibility of SDN programs. To solve this problem, we propose to modularize the SDN compiler by leveraging intermediate representation (IR), a common technique for computer compiler design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Rule (SR) as the first IR for SDN compilers, which is a simple, language-independent, and semantic-preserving representation. We develop two optimizations on the semantic rule to coordinate cross-language programs in a single network and compress the number of compiled rules. We implement a modular compiler prototype with the proposed SR, and demonstrate that RYU programs can run at both OpenFlow and POF network. With synthetic network configurations, we demonstrate that the optimizations on SRs are effective, efficient and scalable.",Computer Science,0,0,software defined networking sdn evolving phase multiple programming language rule specification coexist however current sdn compiler closely bound language rule thus disable interoperability compatibility sdn program solve problem propose modularize sdn compiler leveraging intermediate representation ir common technique computer compiler design specifically introduce semantic rule sr first ir sdn compiler simple languageindependent semanticpreserving representation develop two optimization semantic rule coordinate crosslanguage program single network compress number compiled rule implement modular compiler prototype proposed sr demonstrate ryu program run openflow pof network synthetic network configuration demonstrate optimization sr effective efficient scalable

EPOL consists of a coronagraph and a dual-beam polarimeter with a liquid-crystal retarder to exchange the polarization of the two beams. The polarimetry thereby increases the contrast between star and exoplanet by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude over what the extreme adaptive optics and the EPOL coronagraph alone can achieve.

18600,bdca8ddded04c1c8c93fdb6b6857125cf1ea6bee,Використання системи комп’ютерної математики Maple в курсі «Технічна електродинаміка»,"Інтенсивне впровадження електротехніки, радіотехніки й електроніки майже у всі галузі народного господарства, науку, техніку, медицину, побут поставило перед широким колом фахівців (радіоінженери, інженери з прискорювальних установок, з ядерної техніки, електроніки, автоматики тощо) завдання активного освоєння методів розрахунків електродинамічних задач. Створення та експлуатація новітніх радіоелектронних пристроїв та приладів визначають зростаючу потребу у добре підготованих фахівцях радіотехнічного напряму.У сучасній радіотехніці й зв’язку широке застосування знаходять електромагнітні хвильові процеси і різноманітні пристрої, у яких ці процеси відіграють суттєву роль: передавальні лінії й хвилеводи, випромінювачі й приймальні антени, об’ємні резонатори й фільтри, невзаємні пристрої з феритами, елементи обчислювальних машин і комутаційних пристроїв, що працюють у сантиметровому або оптичному діапазоні.Курс «Технічна електродинаміка» та подібні до нього є обов’язковими для вивчення під час підготовки фахівців. Крім того, електродинаміка є важливою частиною теоретичної фізики, тому курси з електродинаміки читаються у переважній більшості університетів, й, у тій або іншій формі, і в ряді вищих технічних навчальних закладів.За програмою цього курсу найчастіше розглядаються наступні теми:1. Елементи векторного аналізу та математичної теорії поля2. Рівняння Максвелла3. Пласкі електромагнітні хвилі4. Відбиття та переломлення пласких електромагнітних хвиль5. Стале електричне поле6. Стале магнітне поле7. Поширення електромагнітних хвиль8. Хвилеводи9. Об’ємні резонаториВивчення вище перелічених тем вимагає використовувати такі операції з математичної теорії поля, як градієнт, ротор, дивергенція, скалярний та векторний добуток векторів тощо, розв’язувати рівняння у частинних похідних за методами Д’Аламбера (поширення хвиль), відокремлення змінних (рівняння Лапласа, Пуассона, Гельмгольця), визначати структури полів (типи хвиль) у хвилевідних лініях та об’ємних резонаторахЗ іншого боку, чільне місце у підготовці майбутнього фахівця посідає місце вміння використовування систем комп’ютерної математики (СКМ). Підготовка майбутнього фахівця до використання інформаційно-комунікаційних технологій має відбуватися не тільки на заняттях з дисциплін природничо-наукового циклу, а насамперед під час вивчення фундаментальних дисциплін.До простих і відносно нескладних систем комп’ютерної математики, щоправда з дещо обмеженими можливостями, відносять системи Derive та різні версії системи Mathcad. Система Derive вважається навчальною СКМ початкового рівня. Вона функціонує на основі мови штучного інтелекту (MuLisp) і є найменш вимогливою до апаратних можливостей персональних комп’ютерів: це єдина система, яка здатна працювати навіть на комп’ютерах раритетного класу IBM PC ХТ без жорсткого диску. Проте за можливостями вона не може конкурувати з системами більш високого класу ані у чисельних розрахунках, ані у символьних перетвореннях, ані у графічній візуалізації результатів обчислень.До середнього рівня СКМ відносять системи класу Mathcad. Ця СКМ має висококласну систему чисельних обчислень, проте дещо обмежену систему символьних перетворень, що реалізовано системою MuPAD (достатньо сказати, що лише 300 функцій ядра MuPAD доступні у Mathcad). Втім, графічні можливості різних версій Mathcad мало чим поступаються графіці більш складних СКМ.Більшість перших CKM призначалася для чисельних розрахунків. Їх результат завжди конкретний – це або число, або набір чисел, що зображується у вигляді таблиці, матриці або точок графіків. Однак вони не надавали можливості одержати загальні формули, що описують розв’язок задач. Як правило, з результатів чисельних обчислень неможливо було зробити загальні теоретичні, а часом і практичні висновки. Символьні (чи, інакше, аналітичні) операції – це якраз те, що кардинально відрізняє системи класу Maple та Mathematica (і подібні їм символьні математичні системи) від систем для виконання чисельних розрахунків. Під час виконання символьних операцій завдання на обчислення складаються у вигляді символьних (формульних) виразів, і результати обчислень також подаються у символьному вигляді. Числові результати при цьому є окремими, частковими випадками символьних.Вирази, що зображено у символьному вигляді, відрізняються високим ступенем загальності.Maple та Mathematica мають приблизно однакові можливості як в галузі символьних обчислень, так і в галузі числових розрахунків. Варто відзначити, що інтерфейс Maple є більш інтуїтивно зрозумілим, ніж у більш строгої системи Mathematica. Обидві системи в останніх реалізаціях зробили якісний стрибок у напрямі ефективності розв’язання задач в числовому вигляді, зокрема через підвищення швидкості виконання матричних операцій або застосування СКМ Matlab.Як ілюстрацію застосування СКМ Maple до курсу технічної електродинаміки розглянемо кілька прикладів розв’язання типових задач.1. Визначити дивергенцію і ротор векторного поля , яке має в декартовій системі координат єдину складову .with(VectorCalculus):F := VectorField(<20*sin(x/Pi),0,0>, ’cartesian’[x,y,z]); div := Divergence(F);  rot := Curl(F); 2.

Визначити дивергенцію і ротор векторного поля , яке має в сферичній системі координат єдину складову Аθ = 8r ехр (– 10r).F := VectorField( <0,0,8*r*exp(-10*r)>, ’spherical’[r,phi,theta] );  div := Divergence(F);  rot := Curl(F); 4.

використовувати під час викладання курсу «Технічна електродинаміка» або подібні до нього, особливо на практичних заняттях або під час самостійної підготовки студентів, щоб суттєво зменшити час на

The general trajectory, then, is summarized as the following: “Each operates by identifying and dismantling a false apodicity, showing the play of shadows for what it is, like the prisoners in Plato’s cave who releases the blinkers on the others” (123). The key question that troubles the remainder of the book comes from Mark C. Taylor’s 1992 essay “nO nOt nO” in which he asks “is his [Derrida’s] nonsaying a saying? A denegation?” (123). RaymentPickard’s response to this difficult question is to posit a series of responses that begin with a consideration of Jacques Derrida as a “negative theologian” (John D. Caputo) and ends with the possibility of Derrida as a “Kantian idealist” á la Kevin Hart. Between these two theological poles lies, of course, the “khora,” which serves as an impasse, making a conclusive exposition of Derrida’s theology impossible. This impossibility, however, is an “apophasis of khora,” which invites speculation on a “Christological heterology” (163) as well as other figurations of the multiple that do not compromise the radicality of Derridean anti-theology. This final meditation on the failure of closure/completion and the primordial status of the “chiasmus” as the other figure in philosophy offers a careful reassertion of the deconstructive principle of indeterminacy. Herein lies the significance of Rayment-Pickard’s title: Is Derridean “indeterminacy” theology’s impossible God? One could argue, as the author does, that it is. With its clear discussions of Husserl, Heidegger, and Derrida and its reassessment of philosophical impossibility through the lens of theology, Impossible God is an important addition to current discussions in religious theory.",,0,0,perception prepares way derrida radical uncertainty différance general trajectory summarized following operates identifying dismantling false apodicity showing play shadow like prisoner plato cave release blinker others key question trouble remainder book come mark c taylor essay asks derrida nonsaying saying denegation raymentpickards response difficult question posit series response begin consideration jacques derrida negative theologian john caputo end possibility derrida kantian idealist á la kevin hart two theological pole lie course khora serf impasse making conclusive exposition derrida theology impossible impossibility however apophasis khora invite speculation christological heterology well figuration multiple compromise radicality derridean antitheology final meditation failure closurecompletion primordial status chiasmus figure philosophy offer careful reassertion deconstructive principle indeterminacy herein lie significance raymentpickards title derridean indeterminacy theology impossible god one could argue author clear discussion husserl heidegger derrida reassessment philosophical impossibility lens theology impossible god important addition current discussion religious theory

He approaches this paradox as both an exercise in theology and in revisionist Christian history based on philosophical analysis. This unorthodox interpretation of the history of modern Christianity will provoke renewed discussion about the historical, intellectual, and cultural importance of neo-Augustinianism.

Grenz extends the engagement between Christian theology and the Western philosophical tradition and focuses the discussion on the importance of naming, particularly given that the Christian God is both named and triune. In doing so, he organizes the book into three parts, forming an overarching story of the interplay between the named character of God and the question of being. First he analyzes the history of the philosophical concept of Being, then he shifts the focus to an exegesis of the ""I Am"" texts, and finally he moves to a renewed conversation between theology and ontological philosophy by means of the divine name.",Philosophy,0,0,book stanley grenz examines longstanding trajectory thought equated concept god bibleand thus claimed ontological category guiding concept god understood grenz extends engagement christian theology western philosophical tradition focus discussion importance naming particularly given christian god named triune organizes book three part forming overarching story interplay named character god question first analyzes history philosophical concept shift focus exegesis text finally move renewed conversation theology ontological philosophy mean divine name

In the proposed Arbitration Fairness Act, Congress would ban such clauses in all consumer contracts, including in the securities industry. However, securities arbitration - whose fairness is regulated with substantial oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission - does not suffer from the same features and flaws that critics of arbitration in other forums have excoriated as oppressively unfair. In the recently-enacted Dodd-Frank Act, Congress delegated to the SEC the authority to prohibit arbitration clauses in customer agreements through admininstrative rule-making. After examining these regulatory efforts, I argue that neither Congress nor the SEC should prohibit mandatory securities arbitration because it would have significant adverse consequences for investors and for the vitality of the dispute resolution mechanism. The essay concludes by asserting that regulators should not enact arbitration reform that needlessly and without foundation brands securities arbitration as the evil twin of adhesive consumer arbitration.",Business,0,0,essay examine recent congressional effort ban predispute arbitration clause security brokerage account agreement thus eliminate mandatory arbitration customerbroker dispute proposed arbitration fairness act congress would ban clause consumer contract including security industry however security arbitration whose fairness regulated substantial oversight security exchange commission suffer feature flaw critic arbitration forum excoriated oppressively unfair recentlyenacted doddfrank act congress delegated sec authority prohibit arbitration clause customer agreement admininstrative rulemaking examining regulatory effort argue neither congress sec prohibit mandatory security arbitration would significant adverse consequence investor vitality dispute resolution mechanism essay concludes asserting regulator enact arbitration reform needlessly without foundation brand security arbitration evil twin adhesive consumer arbitration

A set S ⊆ V is a total dominating set if every vertex of V is adjacent to some vertex in S. The total domination number of G, denoted by Υt(G), is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of G. We establish a property of minimum total dominating sets in graphs. If G is a connected graph of order n ≥ 3, then (see [3]) Υt(G) ≤ 2n-3. We show that if G is a connected graph of order n with minimum degree at least 2, then either Υt(G) ≤ 4n-7 or G e {C3, C5, C6, C10}. A characterization of those graphs of order n which are edge-minimal with respect to satisfying G connected, δ(G) e 2 and Υt(G) ≥ 4n-7 is obtained.

1705,6d722fd82c34e94d60b56c19dfa6501bedcd5a77,Hiddenness and Transcendence,"For over two decades, the philosophical literature on divine hiddenness has been concerned with just one problem about divine hiddenness that arises out of one very particular concept of God. The problem—call it the Schellenberg problem—has J. L. Schellenberg as both its inventor and its most ardent defender. This chapter argues that the Schellenberg problem is an attack on a straw deity. More specifically, it proposes that Schellenberg’s argument against the existence of God depends on certain theological claims that are not commitments of traditional Christian theology and that would, furthermore, be repudiated by many of the most important and influential theologians in the Christian tradition. The chapter closes with some very brief remarks about the implications of this conclusion for what is taken to be the real import of the Schellenberg problem.",Philosophy,0,0,two decade philosophical literature divine hiddenness concerned one problem divine hiddenness arises one particular concept god problemcall schellenberg problemhas j l schellenberg inventor ardent defender chapter argues schellenberg problem attack straw deity specifically proposes schellenbergs argument existence god depends certain theological claim commitment traditional christian theology would furthermore repudiated many important influential theologian christian tradition chapter close brief remark implication conclusion taken real import schellenberg problem
25189,d5fdb1eaae63b8dd6d2b4dfdf440c47780e01e5a,Religious Language,"When are sentences A and B the same belief? Following Quine, observation sentences A and B are the same belief when they share the same stimulus–meaning, similar patterns of assent and dissent by subjects when the sentences are queried in the presence of the same non–linguistic stimuli. As for non–observation sentences we note a suggestion of Karl Schick: apply linguistic stimuli in the form of utterances of the language, and map the connections between sentences in the language in terms of linguistic conditioned–responses to utterances. The mapping will yield a network of relations between non–observation sentences themselves, and between the latter and observation sentences at the ‘periphery’. Thus, each sentence receives its place in the overall criss–crossing of relations in the network of the language. Out of a commitment to the ‘autonomy of meaning’, we can say that when A and B are non–observational, they are the same belief when they occupy similar places in the network of sentences in a given language, or corresponding places in corresponding networks of two languages. (Since we can identify the place of sentences in the language network, and since the present suggestion identifies the sameness of belief with location identity, it turns out that there needn't be indeterminacy of translocation.)",,0,0,sentence b belief following quine observation sentence b belief share stimulusmeaning similar pattern assent dissent subject sentence queried presence nonlinguistic stimulus nonobservation sentence note suggestion karl schick apply linguistic stimulus form utterance language map connection sentence language term linguistic conditionedresponses utterance mapping yield network relation nonobservation sentence latter observation sentence periphery thus sentence receives place overall crisscrossing relation network language commitment autonomy meaning say b nonobservational belief occupy similar place network sentence given language corresponding place corresponding network two language since identify place sentence language network since present suggestion identifies sameness belief location identity turn neednt indeterminacy translocation

Here we investigate the shapes and relative orientations of the stars and dark matter of halos and subhalos (central and satellite) extracted from the MassiveBlack-II simulation, a state-of-the-art high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation which includes stellar and AGN feedback in a volume of $(100{h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}})^3$. We consider redshift evolution from $z=1$ to $0.06$ and mass evolution within the range of subhalo masses, $10^{10} -6.0 \times 10^{14.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$. The shapes of the dark matter distributions are generally more round than the shapes defined by stellar matter. The projected root-mean-square (RMS) ellipticity per component for stellar matter is measured to be $e_\text{rms} = 0.28$ at $z=0.3$ for $M_{subhalo}> 10^{12.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$, which compares favourably with observational measurements. We find that the shapes of stellar and dark matter are more round for less massive subhalos and at lower redshifts. By directly measuring the relative orientation of the stellar matter and dark matter of subgroups, we find that, on average, the misalignment between the two components is larger for less massive subhalos. The mean misalignment angle varies from $\sim 30^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$ for $M \sim 10^{10} - 10^{14} {h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$ and shows a weak dependence on redshift. We also compare the misalignment angles in central and satellite subhalos at fixed subhalo mass, and find that centrals are more misaligned than satellites.

The second-generation of clinically approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and much of the current ADC pipeline in clinical trials contain the maleimide linkage. However, thiosuccinimide linkages are now known to be less robust than once thought, and ergo, are correlated with suboptimal pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles in some ADC constructs. Rational design of novel generations of maleimides and maleimide-type reagents have been reported to address the shortcomings of classical maleimides, allowing for the formation of robust bioconjugate linkages. This review highlights the main strategies for rational reagent design that have allowed irreversible bioconjugations in cysteines, reversible labelling strategies and disulfide re-bridging.",Medicine;Chemistry,0,0,maleimide chemistry stand bioconjugation toolbox virtue synthetic accessibility excellent reactivity practicability secondgeneration clinically approved antibodydrug conjugate adc much current adc pipeline clinical trial contain maleimide linkage however thiosuccinimide linkage known le robust thought ergo correlated suboptimal pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics safety profile adc construct rational design novel generation maleimides maleimidetype reagent reported address shortcoming classical maleimides allowing formation robust bioconjugate linkage review highlight main strategy rational reagent design allowed irreversible bioconjugations cysteine reversible labelling strategy disulfide rebridging

In Being and Time, Heidegger designs a philosophy that can co-exist with a radical Lutheran theology of revelation. Heidegger's hermeneutics of facticity constitutes a polemic with the Scholastic idea of a natural desire for God and an accommodation of a theology of revelation. However, Heidegger's implicit assent to the Lutheran concept of God-forsakenness is philosophically problematic. To be God-forsaken is not to be ignorant of God; it is to be abandoned by God, to have a history of dealing with God that has resulted in a decisive rupture and distance.

I hold that the former is essential to Christian faith, the latter an impediment to it. Several recent writers in the philosophy of religion have however assumed that to believe in God is to believe in a person. The most subtle and influential proponent of ‘bodiless person theism’ is Richard Swinburne. I hope to show that this philosophical presentation of theism is unwarrantable and misrepresents what the theological tradition says about God. In section (I) I describe how Swinburne justifies his view that God is a person. In section (II) I show that this view is defective. In section (III) I uncover a common, though mistaken, procedure among several other advocates of this type of theism. In section (IV) I suggest that the belief that God is a person is foreign to Christian theology, with the unfortunate consequence that a philosophical defence of it is not only mistaken: it is also pointless.",Philosophy,0,0,one belief personal god must one also believe god person hold former essential christian faith latter impediment several recent writer philosophy religion however assumed believe god believe person subtle influential proponent bodiless person theism richard swinburne hope show philosophical presentation theism unwarrantable misrepresents theological tradition say god section describe swinburne justifies view god person section ii show view defective section iii uncover common though mistaken procedure among several advocate type theism section iv suggest belief god person foreign christian theology unfortunate consequence philosophical defence mistaken also pointless

In particular, we consider chiral theories where a single fermion zero mode is excited in the string core, such as those arising in supersymmetric theories with a D-term. The resulting vortons formed in such theories are expected to be more stable than their non-chiral cousins. General symmetry breaking schemes are considered in which strings formed at one symmetry breaking scale become current-carrying at a subsequent phase transition. The vorton abundance is estimated and constraints placed on the underlying particle physics theories from cosmological observations. Our constraints on the chiral theory are considerably more stringent than the previous estimates for more general theories.",Physics,0,0,investigate cosmological consequence particle physic theory admit stable loop currentcarrying string vortons particular consider chiral theory single fermion zero mode excited string core arising supersymmetric theory dterm resulting vortons formed theory expected stable nonchiral cousin general symmetry breaking scheme considered string formed one symmetry breaking scale become currentcarrying subsequent phase transition vorton abundance estimated constraint placed underlying particle physic theory cosmological observation constraint chiral theory considerably stringent previous estimate general theory

It is also natural to suppose that this knowledge is propositional knowledge-to know what a word means is to know that it means such-and-such. Thus it is prima facie plausible to suppose that understanding a bit of language consists in possessing propositional knowledge of its meaning. I refer to this as the epistemic view of understanding language. The theoretical appeal of this view for the philosophy of language is that it provides for an attractive account of the project of the theory of meaning. If understanding language consists in possessing propositional knowledge of the meanings of expressions, then a meaning theory amounts to a theory of what speakers know in virtue of understanding language. In this paper I argue that, despite its intuitive and theoretical appeal, the epistemic view is false. Propositional knowledge is not necessary for understanding language, not even tacit knowledge. Unlike knowledge, I argue, linguistic understanding does not fail in Gettier cases, does not require epistemic warrant and does not even require belief. The intuitions about knowledge that have been central to epistemology do not seem to hold for linguistic understanding. So unless epistemologists have been radically mistaken about what knowledge requires, knowledge is unnecessary for understanding language.",Philosophy,0,0,natural thought understanding language consists possessing knowledgeto understand word know mean also natural suppose knowledge propositional knowledgeto know word mean know mean suchandsuch thus prima facie plausible suppose understanding bit language consists possessing propositional knowledge meaning refer epistemic view understanding language theoretical appeal view philosophy language provides attractive account project theory meaning understanding language consists possessing propositional knowledge meaning expression meaning theory amount theory speaker know virtue understanding language paper argue despite intuitive theoretical appeal epistemic view false propositional knowledge necessary understanding language even tacit knowledge unlike knowledge argue linguistic understanding fail gettier case require epistemic warrant even require belief intuition knowledge central epistemology seem hold linguistic understanding unless epistemologist radically mistaken knowledge requires knowledge unnecessary understanding language

Thus the book is divided into parts, reflecting how a proper understanding of God’s revelation can be reached systemically, with each part offering an avenue by which to comprehend divine disclosure. Some chapters deal with the biblical background to revelation; others examine the delicate relationship between a Christian understanding of the fulfilment of revelation in Christ and the original revelation given to Moses and Abraham, and to the created whole in the act of creation; yet others explore the theological aspects of revelation, from the Trinitarian problematic to charismatic forms of revelation. The philosophical explorations of revelation show the importance of philosophical reflection on revelation today and over time. A radical understanding of revelation is the ultimate horizon of the reality of divine revelation, connecting biblical, theological, philosophical, historical and comparative, and scientific approaches. Revelation-related forms in Hinduism, Buddhism, the Chinese tradition, and African religions contribute to an understanding of the important role of divine revelation in connecting cultures and religions around the globe. The notion of revelation in Judaism and Islam also has a paramount role in any comparative understanding, which must extend to the importance of our conceptions of revelation in the context of European history, especially the Holocaust, a watershed in our contemporary reflections on revelation which triggered radical re-evaluation of traditional theological and philosophical conceptions.",,0,0,following eminent predecessor recent decade volume take multidisciplinary approach notion divine revelation examine mean time thus book divided part reflecting proper understanding god revelation reached systemically part offering avenue comprehend divine disclosure chapter deal biblical background revelation others examine delicate relationship christian understanding fulfilment revelation christ original revelation given moses abraham created whole act creation yet others explore theological aspect revelation trinitarian problematic charismatic form revelation philosophical exploration revelation show importance philosophical reflection revelation today time radical understanding revelation ultimate horizon reality divine revelation connecting biblical theological philosophical historical comparative scientific approach revelationrelated form hinduism buddhism chinese tradition african religion contribute understanding important role divine revelation connecting culture religion around globe notion revelation judaism islam also paramount role comparative understanding must extend importance conception revelation context european history especially holocaust watershed contemporary reflection revelation triggered radical reevaluation traditional theological philosophical conception

Such quantum walks do not converge to any stationary distribution, as they are unitary and reversible. However, by suitably relaxing the definition, we can obtain a measure of how fast the quantum walk spreads or how confined the quantum walk stays in a small neighborhood. We give definitions of mixing time, filling time, dispersion time. We show that in all these measures, the quantum walk on the cycle is almost quadratically faster then its classical correspondent. On the other hand, we give a lower bound on the possible speed up by quantum walks for general graphs, showing that quantum walks can be at most polynomially faster than their classical counterparts.",Mathematics;Physics;Computer Science,0,0,set ground theory quantum walk graphsthe generalization random walk finite graph quantum world quantum walk converge stationary distribution unitary reversible however suitably relaxing definition obtain measure fast quantum walk spread confined quantum walk stay small neighborhood give definition mixing time filling time dispersion time show measure quantum walk cycle almost quadratically faster classical correspondent hand give lower bound possible speed quantum walk general graph showing quantum walk polynomially faster classical counterpart

This thesis, if true, would have important consequences for philosophy of mind and cognitive science. In this paper I offer two arguments for it. The first argument claims it would be impossible introspectively to distinguish conscious thoughts with respect to their content if there weren’t something it’s like to think them. This argument is defended against several objections. The second argument uses what I call “minimal pair” experiences—sentences read without and with understanding—to induce in the reader an experience of the kind I claim exists.

Definition 1. A problem is a problem I cannot solve, not necessarily an unsolved problem. 1. Sums and differences For any set A of integers, we define the sumset A + A = {a + a : a, a ∈ A} and the difference set A − A = {a− a : a, a ∈ A}. In this section we consider finite sets of integers, and the relative sizes of their sumsets and difference sets. If A is a finite set of integers and x, y ∈ Z, then the translation of A by x is the set x + A = {x + a : a ∈ A} and the dilation of A by y is y ∗ A = {ya : a ∈ A}. We have (x + A) + (x + A) = 2x + 2A and (x + A) − (x + A) = A − A. Similarly, y ∗ A + y ∗ A = y ∗ (A + A) and y ∗ A − y ∗ A = y ∗ (A − A). It follows that |(x + y ∗ A) + (x + y ∗ A)| = |2A| and |(x + y ∗ A) − (x + y ∗ A)| = |A − A| so the cardinalities of the sum and difference sets of a finite set of integers are invariant under affine transformations of the set. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11B05, 11B13, 11B34.",Mathematics,0,0,talk atelier en combinatoire additive workshop arithmetic combinatorics centre de recherches mathématiques université de montréal april definition problem problem solve necessarily unsolved problem sum difference set integer define sumset difference set section consider finite set integer relative size sumsets difference set finite set integer x z translation x set x x dilation ya x x x x x similarly follows x x x x cardinality sum difference set finite set integer invariant affine transformation set mathematics subject classification b b b

Additionally, activation of NF-κB in cancer cells by chemotherapy or by radiation can blunt the ability of the cancer therapy to induce cell death.

Its radio emissions fill the entire spectral region where interplanetary electromagnetic propagation is possible at wavelengths longer than infrared. Three distinct types of radiation are responsible for this radio spectrum. Thermal emission from the atmosphere accounts for virtually all the radiation at the high frequency end. Synchrotron emission from the trapped high-energy particle belt deep within the inner magnetosphere is the dominant spectral component from about 4000 to 40 MHz. The third class of radiation consists of several distinct components of sporadic low frequency emission below 40 MHz. The decimeter wavelength emission is considered, taking into account the discovery of synchrotron emission, radiation by high-energy electrons in a magnetic field, and the present status of Jovian synchrotron phenomenology.

The strategy is to distinguish the logic of suffering, which is reducible to the binary terms of propositional logic, from the logic of repair, which is not. The essay argues that, if reduced to such binary terms, efforts at repair become inadvertent acts of oppression, or acts that produce suffering. The essay concludes that postmodern and postliberal theorists become inadvertent oppressors when their attempts to repair modern inquiry are presented through propositional logics. The practice of SR should be irreducible to such logics.",Philosophy,0,0,addressing reader already acquainted practice scriptural reasoning sr essay offer logical strategy warranting testing practice well postmodern criticism modern inquiry strategy distinguish logic suffering reducible binary term propositional logic logic repair essay argues reduced binary term effort repair become inadvertent act oppression act produce suffering essay concludes postmodern postliberal theorist become inadvertent oppressor attempt repair modern inquiry presented propositional logic practice sr irreducible logic

Using this assay to monitor ribosome transit on bovine preprolactin mRNA, we have detected four major positions of ribosome pausing in both wheat‐germ and rabbit reticulocyte extracts. Two of these rate‐limiting steps represent initiation and termination. One pause occurs after approximately 75 amino acids have been polymerized; signal recognition particle arrests preprolactin synthesis at this position. The other internal pause occurs at 160 amino acids. In these latter two cases ribosomes stop at a GGC glycine codon; however, two other GGC codons are translated without apparent pausing. Surprisingly, we find that up to nine ribosomes are tightly stacked behind each pausing ribosome, such that the ribosome centers are only 27‐29 nucleotides apart. The assay should prove useful for probing mechanisms of translational regulation.",Biology;Medicine,0,0,devised sensitive assay determine distribution translating ribosome mrna using assay monitor ribosome transit bovine preprolactin mrna detected four major position ribosome pausing wheatgerm rabbit reticulocyte extract two ratelimiting step represent initiation termination one pause occurs approximately amino acid polymerized signal recognition particle arrest preprolactin synthesis position internal pause occurs amino acid latter two case ribosome stop ggc glycine codon however two ggc codon translated without apparent pausing surprisingly find nine ribosome tightly stacked behind pausing ribosome ribosome center nucleotide apart assay prove useful probing mechanism translational regulation

On the basis of magnetic field measurements during the descent and subsequent multiple touchdown of the Rosetta lander Philae on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P), we show that no global magnetic field was detected within the limitations of analysis. The Rosetta Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor (ROMAP) suite of sensors measured an upper magnetic field magnitude of less than 2 nanotesla at the cometary surface at multiple locations, with the upper specific magnetic moment being <3.1 × 10−5 ampere–square meters per kilogram for meter-size homogeneous magnetized boulders. The maximum dipole moment of 67P is 1.6 × 108 ampere–square meters.

The acyclic edge chromatic number of G, denoted by a′(G), is the least number of colors in an acyclic edge coloring of G. For certain graphs G, a′(G) ≥ Δ(G) + 2 where Δ(G) is the maximum degree in G. It is known that a′(G) ≤ 16 Δ(G) for any graph G. We prove that there exists a constant c such that a′(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 2 for any graph G whose girth is at least cΔ(G) log Δ(G), and conjecture that this upper bound for a′(G) holds for all graphs G.

Further, we show that there are homomorphism–homogeneous graphs that do not contain the Rado graph as a spanning subgraph answering the second open question. We also treat the case of homomorphism–homogeneous graphs with loops allowed, showing that the corresponding decision problem is co–NP complete. Finally, we extend the list of considered morphism–types and show that the graphs for which monomorphisms can be extended to epimor‐phisms are complements of homomorphism–homogeneous graphs. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previously proposed implementable dispatching schemes from the first stage to the second stage, such as random dispatching (RD), are not able to achieve high throughput unless the internal bandwidth is expanded. This paper presents two round-robin-based dispatching schemes to overcome the throughput limitation of the RD scheme. First, we introduce a concurrent round-robin dispatching (CRRD) scheme for the Clos-network switch. The CRRD scheme provides high switch throughput without expanding internal bandwidth. CRRD implementation is very simple because only simple round-robin arbiters are adopted. We show via simulation that CRRD achieves 100% throughput under uniform traffic. When the offered load reaches 1.0, the pointers of round-robin arbiters at the first- and second-stage modules are completely desynchronized and contention is avoided. Second, we introduce a concurrent master-slave round-robin dispatching (CMSD) scheme as an improved version of CRRD to make it more scalable. CMSD uses hierarchical round-robin arbitration. We show that CMSD preserves the advantages of CRRD, reduces the scheduling time by 30% or more when arbitration time is significant and has a dramatically reduced number of crosspoints of the interconnection wires between round-robin arbiters in the dispatching scheduler with a ratio of 1/√N, where N is the switch size. This makes CMSD easier to implement than CRRD when the switch size becomes large.",Computer Science,0,0,closnetwork switch architecture attractive scalability previously proposed implementable dispatching scheme first stage second stage random dispatching rd able achieve high throughput unless internal bandwidth expanded paper present two roundrobinbased dispatching scheme overcome throughput limitation rd scheme first introduce concurrent roundrobin dispatching crrd scheme closnetwork switch crrd scheme provides high switch throughput without expanding internal bandwidth crrd implementation simple simple roundrobin arbiter adopted show via simulation crrd achieves throughput uniform traffic offered load reach pointer roundrobin arbiter first secondstage module completely desynchronized contention avoided second introduce concurrent masterslave roundrobin dispatching cmsd scheme improved version crrd make scalable cmsd us hierarchical roundrobin arbitration show cmsd preserve advantage crrd reduces scheduling time arbitration time significant dramatically reduced number crosspoints interconnection wire roundrobin arbiter dispatching scheduler ratio n n switch size make cmsd easier implement crrd switch size becomes large

The two that did practice some form of physical circumcision, Judaism and Islam, are described, contrariwise, as possessing in varying degrees a spiritual circumcision. Abulafia's sense of the connectedness between Hebrew and the other languages also implies a historical messianic dimension to his thought.

We start by formulating Hamiltonians to describe how a quantum mechanical electron is affected by classical electric and magnetic fields. Next, we describe the quantization of Maxwell’s equations, which yields a quantum field theory in which the elementary excitations are photons—particles of light. The last step is to formulate a theory in which both electrons and photons are treated on the same footing, as excitations of underlying quantum fields. Along the way, we will see how relativity can be accomodated within quantum mechanics.",,0,0,chapter provides survey quantum electrodynamics quantum theory electromagnetic field interaction electrically charged particle electron start formulating hamiltonians describe quantum mechanical electron affected classical electric magnetic field next describe quantization maxwell equation yield quantum field theory elementary excitation photonsparticles light last step formulate theory electron photon treated footing excitation underlying quantum field along way see relativity accomodated within quantum mechanic

The reasoning is based on the number of finite limit points 2(n-1) which we believe to set the maximum number of positive images and the fact that the number of negative images exceeds the number of positive images by (n-1). It has been known that an n-point lens system (n\ge 3) can produce (3n+1) images and so has been an explicit lens configuration with (3n+1) images. We start with the well-known n-point lens configuration that produces (3n+1) images and produce (2n-1) extra images by adding a small (n+1)-th mass so that the resulting (n+1)-point lens configuration has (2n) discrete limit points and produces 5n images of a source. It still remains to confirm in abstraction that the maximum number of positive image domains of a caustic domain is bounded by the number of the limit points.,Physics,0,0,conjectured astroph gravitational lens consisting n point mass produce n image known case n reasoning based number finite limit point n believe set maximum number positive image fact number negative image exceeds number positive image n known npoint lens system nge produce n image explicit lens configuration n image start wellknown npoint lens configuration produce n image produce n extra image adding small nth mass resulting npoint lens configuration n discrete limit point produce n image source still remains confirm abstraction maximum number positive image domain caustic domain bounded number limit point

The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance—it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration.
PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with the IBM compiler, PL/C permits “pseudo comments”—constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source text or comment.
In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor. It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.",Computer Science,0,0,plc compiler dialect pli design objective provide maximum degree diagnostic assistance batch processing environment part assistance implicit provided automatically compiler remarkable characteristic plc perseveranceit completes translation every program submitted continues execution userestablished error limit reached requires compiler repair error encountered translation execution design plc dominated consideration plc also introduces several explicit usercontrolled facility program testing accommodate extension pli without abandoning compatibility ibm compiler plc permit pseudo commentsconstructions whose content optionally considered either source text comment spite diagnostic effort plc fast efficient processor effectively demonstrates compiler provide better diagnostic assistance customarily offered even sophisticated source language employed assistance need prohibitively costly

How nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes (displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther distances from the barrier. We present evidence for a novel 3' NFR that is present at >95% of all genes. 3' NFRs may be important for transcription termination and anti-sense initiation. We present a high-resolution genome-wide map of TFIIB locations that implicates 3' NFRs in gene looping.",Biology;Medicine,0,0,nucleosomes wellorganized end cerevisiae gene nucleosomes bracket nucleosomefree promoter region nfr nucleosomal organization specified genome le clear establish interrelate rule governing genomic nucleosome organization sequencing dna one million immunopurified cerevisiae nucleosomes displayed httpatlasbxpsuedu evidence presented organization nucleosomes throughout gene largely consequence statistical packing principle genomic sequence specifies location nucleosomes nucleosome form barrier nucleosomes packed resulting uniform positioning decay farther distance barrier present evidence novel nfr present gene nfrs may important transcription termination antisense initiation present highresolution genomewide map tfiib location implicates nfrs gene looping

The purpose of this paper is to explore the roots of this interpretative trend, reassess its merits, and then examine how the Highest Good is portrayed in Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason. We will see that it is in this text, more so than any other, that Kant develops his most philosophically sophisticated account of the Highest Good. Because of the central significance of Kant's doctrine of the Highest Good for both his ethical theory and philosophy of religion, this paper therefore seeks to provide an important corrective to the current received views.",Philosophy,0,0,since publication andrew reaths two conception highest good kant scholar come accept view kant migrated away earlier theological version one secular purpose paper explore root interpretative trend reassess merit examine highest good portrayed kant religion within boundary mere reason see text kant develops philosophically sophisticated account highest good central significance kant doctrine highest good ethical theory philosophy religion paper therefore seek provide important corrective current received view

It is of great interest to link these features to the nature of disorder. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of graphene containing different type of defects. We found that the intensity ratio of the D and D' peak is maximum (∼13) for sp(3)-defects, it decreases for vacancy-like defects (∼7), and it reaches a minimum for boundaries in graphite (∼3.5). This makes Raman Spectroscopy a powerful tool to fully characterize graphene.",Materials Science;Medicine;Physics,0,0,raman spectroscopy able probe disorder graphene defectactivated peak great interest link feature nature disorder present detailed analysis raman spectrum graphene containing different type defect found intensity ratio peak maximum spdefects decrease vacancylike defect reach minimum boundary graphite make raman spectroscopy powerful tool fully characterize graphene

The astro-comb is a combination of an octave-spanning femtosecond laser frequency comb and a Fabry-Pérot cavity used to achieve calibrator line spacings that can be resolved by an astrophysical spectrograph. Systematic spectral shifts associated with the cavity can be 0.1-1 MHz, corresponding to RV errors of 10-100 cm/s, due to the dispersive properties of the cavity mirrors over broad spectral widths. Although these systematic shifts are very stable, their correction is crucial to high accuracy astrophysical spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate an in-situ technique to determine the systematic shifts of astro-comb lines due to finite Fabry-Pérot cavity dispersion. The technique is practical for implementation at a telescope-based spectrograph to enable wavelength calibration accuracy better than 10 cm/s.",Medicine;Physics,0,0,improved wavelength calibrators highresolution astrophysical spectrograph essential precision radial velocity rv detection earthlike exoplanets direct observation cosmological deceleration astrocomb combination octavespanning femtosecond laser frequency comb fabrypérot cavity used achieve calibrator line spacing resolved astrophysical spectrograph systematic spectral shift associated cavity mhz corresponding rv error cm due dispersive property cavity mirror broad spectral width although systematic shift stable correction crucial high accuracy astrophysical spectroscopy demonstrate insitu technique determine systematic shift astrocomb line due finite fabrypérot cavity dispersion technique practical implementation telescopebased spectrograph enable wavelength calibration accuracy better cm

The ADR consists of three stages in order to provide stable detector cooling using either a 1.2 K superfluid helium bath or a 4.5 K Joule-Thomson (JT) cryocooler as its heat sink. When liquid helium is present, two of the ADR’s stages are used to single-shot cool the detectors while rejecting heat to the helium. After the helium is depleted, all three stages are used to cool both the helium tank (to about 1.5 K) and the detectors (to 50 mK) using the JT cryocooler as its heat sink.

Although Th1 cells exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than Th2 cells, both cell types completely eradicated tumors when transferred into mice bearing A20 tumor cells transfected with the OVA gene (A20-OVA). Th1 cells eradicated the tumor mass by inducing cellular immunity, whereas Th2 cells destroyed the tumor by inducing tumor necrosis. Both Th1 and Th2 cells required CD8+ T cells to eliminate tumors, and neither of these cells were able to completely eliminate A20-OVA tumors from T and B cell–deficient RAG2−/− mice. Mice cured from tumors by Th1 and Th2 cell therapy rejected A20-OVA upon rechallenge, but CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes were induced only from spleen cells prepared from cured mice by Th1 cell therapy. Moreover, we demonstrated that Th1 and Th2 cells used distinct adhesion mechanisms during tumor eradication: the leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1–dependent cell–cell adhesion step was essential for Th1 cell therapy, but not for Th2 cell therapy. These findings demonstrated for the first time the distinct role of antigen-specific Th1 and Th2 cells during eradication of established tumors in vivo.",Medicine;Biology,0,0,role helper type th th cell tumor immunity investigated using th cell induced ovalbumin ovaspecific cell receptor transgenic mouse although th cell exhibited stronger cytotoxicity th cell cell type completely eradicated tumor transferred mouse bearing tumor cell transfected ovum gene aova th cell eradicated tumor mass inducing cellular immunity whereas th cell destroyed tumor inducing tumor necrosis th th cell required cd cell eliminate tumor neither cell able completely eliminate aova tumor b celldeficient rag mouse mouse cured tumor th th cell therapy rejected aova upon rechallenge cd cytotoxic lymphocyte induced spleen cell prepared cured mouse th cell therapy moreover demonstrated th th cell used distinct adhesion mechanism tumor eradication leukocyte functionassociated antigen lfadependent cellcell adhesion step essential th cell therapy th cell therapy finding demonstrated first time distinct role antigenspecific th th cell eradication established tumor vivo

This paper reports a strategy to deliver Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) plasmid by a nanocarrier with a core of gold nanoclusters (GNs) and a shell of lipids. By modifying the GNs with HIV‐1‐transactivator of transcription peptide, the cargo (Cas9/sgRNA) can be delivered into cell nuclei. This strategy is utilized to treat melanoma by designing sgRNA targeting Polo‐like kinase‐1 (Plk1) of the tumor. The nanoparticle (polyethylene glycol‐lipid/GNs/Cas9 protein/sgPlk1 plasmid, LGCP) leads to >70% down‐regulation of Plk1 protein expression of A375 cells in vitro. Moreover, the LGCP suppresses melanoma progress by 75% on mice.

For more or less any regularized quantum field theory there is a corresponding theory of particle motion, which, in particular, ascribes trajectories to the electrons or whatever sort of particles the quantum field theory is about. Corresponding to the nonconservation of the particle number operator in the quantum field theory, the theory describes explicit creation and annihilation events: the world lines for the particles can begin and end.",Physics;Medicine,0,0,discus recently proposed extension bohmian mechanic quantum field theory le regularized quantum field theory corresponding theory particle motion particular ascribes trajectory electron whatever sort particle quantum field theory corresponding nonconservation particle number operator quantum field theory theory describes explicit creation annihilation event world line particle begin end

20188,588b08932ebaa44c84745ac56efbf75f0045058a,Geometric Complexity Theory I: An Approach to the P vs. NP and Related Problems,"We suggest an approach based on geometric invariant theory to the fundamental lower bound problems in complexity theory concerning formula and circuit size. Specifically, we introduce the notion of a partially stable point in a reductive-group representation, which generalizes the notion of stability in geometric invariant theory due to Mumford [Geometric Invariant Theory, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1965]. Then we reduce fundamental lower bound problems in complexity theory to problems concerning infinitesimal neighborhoods of the orbits of partially stable points. We also suggest an approach to tackle the latter class of problems via construction of explicit obstructions.",Mathematics;Computer Science,0,0,suggest approach based geometric invariant theory fundamental lower bound problem complexity theory concerning formula circuit size specifically introduce notion partially stable point reductivegroup representation generalizes notion stability geometric invariant theory due mumford geometric invariant theory springerverlag berlin reduce fundamental lower bound problem complexity theory problem concerning infinitesimal neighborhood orbit partially stable point also suggest approach tackle latter class problem via construction explicit obstruction
