oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:53448,Climate business for poverty reduction? The role of the World Bank,"The World Bank is increasingly active in the area of climate change mitigation. While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a “climate profiteer” and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank’s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/53448,climate business poverty reduction role world bank world bank increasingly active area climate change mitigation justifies engagement poverty reduction objective capacity pave way new business activity developing country critic blame world bank climate profiteer unfair competitor private market econometric analysis project registered may clean development mechanism cdm kyoto protocol allows u compare activity bank primarily private actor result indicate hardly cdm project considered strongly nevertheless comparison rest cdm project bank portfolio show relatively clearer orientation towards poor country within country however bank not show particular focus tends implement project commercially attractive moreover no evidence bank phasing activity market becomes fully operational go professed pioneering catalytic role carbon market,13

The example of the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ in Africa,"Much of poverty alleviation theory and practice fails to sufficiently consider the following crucial factor: the religious dimension. This paper elaborates this thesis by focusing on the African context and the valuable resources African religious communities and movements can provide in the struggle against poverty. One particularly influential streak of present-time African religiousness serves as a case study: the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ as part of Pentecostal Christianity. The author first argues for the continuing formative influence of religion on African conceptions of self, other, and world. Secondly, she provides a critical assessment of the impact of Pentecostalism and the ‘Prosperity Gospel’ on poverty alleviation. In comparison with secular ngos, Pentecostal churches emerge as the more effective agents of change. A third part situates the insights gained into a wider perspective, seeking ways to integrate the religious factor into a more holistic conception of and engagement against poverty.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/108257,long neglected player religious dimension poverty alleviation example prosperity gospel africa much poverty alleviation theory practice fails sufficiently consider following crucial factor religious dimension paper elaborates thesis focusing african context valuable resource african religious community movement provide struggle poverty one particularly influential streak african religiousness serf case study prosperity gospel part pentecostal christianity author first argues continuing formative influence religion african conception self world secondly provides critical assessment impact pentecostalism prosperity gospel poverty alleviation comparison secular ngo pentecostal church emerge effective agent change third part situates insight gained wider perspective seeking way integrate religious factor holistic conception engagement poverty,1

We develop a model where the voting mistakes resulting from low political knowledge reduce the weight of poor voters, and cause parties to choose political platforms that are better aligned with the preferences of rich voters. In US election survey data, we find that income is more important in affecting voting behavior for more informed voters than for less informed voters, as predicted by the model. Further, in a panel of US states we fi*nd that when there is a strong correlation between income and political information, Congress representatives vote more conservatively, which is also in line with our theory.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51540,knowledge power theory information income welfare spending no voter cast vote based perfect information better educated richer voter average better informed others develop model voting mistake resulting low political knowledge reduce weight poor voter cause party choose political platform better aligned preference rich voter u election survey data find income important affecting voting behavior informed voter le informed voter predicted model panel u state fi nd strong correlation income political information congress representative vote conservatively also line theory,16

Presenting material from various Asian and Latin American countries, Frontier Encounters examines factors that make for conflict and accommodation, studies the role of policy frames, and looks at promising mitigation strategies. The range of topics covered by the articles includes the texture of everyday-relations at the settlement frontier and the reconfiguration of ethnic hierarchies in tune with changing conquest cycles; settler land and resource use strategies; anti-settler riots and their politics; peace accords and what they can and cannot achieve as instruments for halting migration-induced violence; communal land titles as a promising avenue for conflict prevention and the empowerment of weak and defenseless groups; and the need for balancing indigenous rights advocacy with support and legal protection for disenfranchised parts of the settler population.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:219394,The pursuit of simplicity: Can simplifying eligibility criteria improve social pension targeting?,"Governments in developing countries struggle to reach intended beneficiaries when targeting social transfers towards vulnerable populations. Rates of eligible individuals not receiving social transfers and ineligible individuals receiving them tend to be high, constraining the effectiveness of such anti-poverty programs. While interventions to incentivize or monitor local agents in charge of selecting beneficiaries are typically expensive, an important complementary and cost-effective approach could be to reform eligibility criteria to facilitate the selection of beneficiaries. Whether reforms should focus on reducing the number of rules, or selecting criteria which are easy to verify, or do both remains an unanswered question. We address this knowledge gap based on India’s social pension scheme for elderly poor. We find that making eligibility criteria easier to verify has the potential to achieve a substantial improvement in the targeting performance through a reduction in the exclusion error. Those who meet the relevant criteria have a much higher chance of actually becoming beneficiaries. Since eligibility criteria can be changed at low cost, this suggests a viable route for reform in many developing countries. However, a major caveat remains that criteria must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty if the more accurate selection of beneficiaries according to formal criteria shall also translate into actual poverty reduction.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/105491,pursuit simplicity simplifying eligibility criterion improve social pension targeting government developing country struggle reach intended beneficiary targeting social transfer towards vulnerable population rate eligible individual not receiving social transfer ineligible individual receiving tend high constraining effectiveness program intervention incentivize monitor local agent charge selecting beneficiary typically expensive important complementary approach could reform eligibility criterion facilitate selection beneficiary whether reform should focus reducing number rule selecting criterion easy verify remains unanswered question address knowledge gap based india social pension scheme elderly poor find making eligibility criterion easier verify potential achieve substantial improvement targeting performance reduction exclusion error meet relevant criterion much higher chance actually becoming beneficiary since eligibility criterion changed low cost suggests viable route reform many developing country however major caveat remains criterion must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty accurate selection beneficiary according formal criterion shall also translate actual poverty reduction,1

Yet, despite numerous recent public and private initiatives to develop capacities  for agricultural innovation, such in itiatives are often not well aligned with national efforts to revive existing Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS). In an effort to improve coordination and responsiveness of Capacity Development (CD) initiatives, the G20 Agriculture Ministers requested the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to lead the development of a Tropical Agricultural Platform (TAP), which is designed to improve coherence and coordination of CD for agricultural innovation in the tropics. This paper presents a summary of the results obtained from three regional needs assessments undertaken by TAP and its partners. The surveyed tropical  regions were Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. The findings reveal a mismatch in all three regions between the external supply of primarily individual CD and the actual demand for institutional CD.  The misalignment might be addressed by strengthening south-south and triangular collaboration and by improving the institutional capacities that would render national AIS more demand-oriented and responsive to the needs of mallholders in domestic agriculture.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/184054,making agricultural innovation system ai work development tropical country agricultural innovation tropical country ontributes effective sustainable use natural resource reduces hunger poverty economic development rural area yet despite numerous recent public private initiative develop capacity agricultural innovation itiatives often not well aligned national effort revive existing agricultural innovation system ai effort improve coordination responsiveness capacity development cd initiative g agriculture minister requested food agriculture organization united nation fao lead development tropical agricultural platform tap designed improve coherence coordination cd agricultural innovation tropic paper present summary result obtained three regional need assessment undertaken tap partner surveyed tropical region southeast asia africa central america finding reveal mismatch three region external supply primarily individual cd actual demand institutional cd misalignment might addressed strengthening triangular collaboration improving institutional capacity would render national ai responsive need mallholders domestic agriculture,2

Estimates of crop growth which are used for crop yield prediction, and timing of forthcoming harvest are important in agricultural planning and policy making. For non-optimal growing conditions, estimates of crop growth may be inaccurate. Crop monitoring during the growing season by means of optical remote sensing can provide information on plant variables that describe the actual status of agricultural crops during the growing season.
In this paper, the assessment of crop vitality through analysis of both field and laboratory measurements of biophysical and biochemical parameters is investigated for wheat and barley, two main crops grown in Switzerland, be it by yield or by area.

New molecular genetic and genomic techniques are available and accessible, but have been grossly underutilized in studies of invertebrate pest invasions, despite that they are useful tools for applied pest management and for understanding fundamental features of pest invasions including pest population demographics and adaptation of pests to novel and/or changing environments. Here, we review current applications of molecular genetics and genomics in the study of invertebrate pest invasions and outbreaks, and we highlight shortcomings from the current body of research. We then discuss recent conceptual and methodological advances in the areas of molecular genetics/genomics and data analysis, and we highlight how these advances will further our understanding of the demographic, ecological, and evolutionary features of invertebrate pest invasions.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:30019,Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?,"BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed no improvement.

More than 80 percent of rice area is distributed in the two northern provinces of Mazandaran and Gilan, so that investment in increasing the quantity and quality can impact an effective role in economic independence and sustainable agriculture. Increased efficiency in rice production is possible through varietal technology, advances in yield enhancement, and the successful development of hybrid technology.

Interactions between parasites can be antagonistic, neutral, or facilitative, and they can have significant implications for epidemiology, disease dynamics, and evolution of virulence. Coinfections commonly result from sequential exposure of hosts to different parasites. We argue that the sequential nature of coinfections is important for the consequences of infection in both natural and man-made environments. Coinfections accumulate during host lifespan, determining the structure of the parasite infracommunity. Interactions within the parasite community and their joint effect on the host individual potentially shape evolution of parasite life‐history traits and transmission biology. Overall, sequential coinfections have the potential to change evolutionary and epidemiological outcomes of host–parasite interactions widely across plant and animal systems.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/116371,importance sequence timing parasite coinfections coinfections multiple parasite predominate wild interaction parasite antagonistic neutral facilitative significant implication epidemiology disease dynamic evolution virulence coinfections commonly result sequential exposure host different parasite argue sequential nature coinfections important consequence infection natural environment coinfections accumulate host lifespan determining structure parasite infracommunity interaction within parasite community joint effect host individual potentially shape evolution parasite trait transmission biology overall sequential coinfections potential change evolutionary epidemiological outcome interaction widely across plant animal system,0

A number of therapeutic options are available for patients with Stage III N2 NSCLC, including surgery [with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx)/neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT)] or CRT potentially followed by adjuvant immunotherapy. We have no clear evidence demonstrating a significant survival benefit for either of these approaches, the selection between treatments is not always straightforward and can come down to physician and patient preference. The very heterogeneous definition of resectability of N2 disease makes the decision-making process even more complex.
Methods: We evaluated the treatment strategies for preoperatively diagnosed stage III cN2 NSCLC among Swiss thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists. Treatment strategies were converted into decision trees and analysed for consensus and discrepancies. We analysed factors relevant to decision-making within these recommendations.
Results: For resectable ""non-bulky"" mediastinal lymph node involvement, there was a trend towards surgery. Numerous participants recommend a surgical approach outside existing guidelines as long as the disease was resectable, even in multilevel N2. With increasing extent of mediastinal nodal disease, multimodal treatment based on radiotherapy was more common.
Conclusions: Both, surgery- or radiotherapy-based treatment regimens are feasible options in the management of Stage III N2 NSCLC.

SUMMARY/BACKGROUND: Only few areas in medicine have seen so many novel therapeutic options over the past decades as for liver tumors. Significant variations may therefore exist regarding the choices of treatment, even among experts, which may confuse both the medical community and patients.
METHODS: Ten cases of CRLM with different levels of complexity were presented to 43 expert liver surgeons from 23 countries and 4 continents. Experts were defined as experienced surgeons with academic contributions to the field of liver tumors. Experts provided information on their medical education and current practice in liver surgery and transplantation. Using an online platform, they chose their strategy in treating each case from defined multiple choices with added comments. Inter-rater agreement among experts and cases was calculated using free-marginal multirater kappa methodology. A similar, but adjusted survey was presented to 60 general surgeons from Asia, Europe, and North America to test their attitude in treating or referring complex patients to expert centers.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight (88%) experts completed the evaluation. Most of them are in leading positions (92%) with a median clinical experience of 25 years. Agreement on therapeutic strategies among them was none to minimal in more than half of the cases with kappa varying from 0.00 to 0.39. Many general surgeons may not refer the complex cases to expert centers, including in Europe, where they also engage in complex liver surgeries.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:224567,Methodological choices in brucellosis burden of disease assessments: A systematic review,"Background
Foodborne and zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis present many challenges to public health and economic welfare. Increasingly, researchers and public health institutes use disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to generate a comprehensive comparison of the population health impact of these conditions. DALYs calculations, however, entail a number of methodological choices and assumptions, with data gaps and uncertainties to accommodate. Thisreview identifies existing brucellosis burden of disease studies and analyzes their methodological choices, assumptions, and uncertainties. It supports the Global Burden of Animal Diseases programme in the development of a systematic methodology to describe the impact of animal diseases on society, including human health.


Methods/Principal findings
A systematic search for brucellosis burden of disease calculations was conducted in pre-selected international and grey literature databases. Using a standardized reporting framework, we evaluated each estimate on a variety of key methodological assumptions necessary to compute a DALY. Fourteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (human brucellosis and quantification of DALYs). One study reported estimates at the global level, the rest were national or subnational assessments. Data regarding different methodological choices were extracted, including detailed assessments of the adopted disease models. Most studies retrieved brucellosis epidemiological data from administrative registries. Incidence data were often estimated on the basis of laboratory-confirmed tests. Not all studies included mortality estimates (Years of Life Lost) in their assessments due to lack of data or the assumption that brucellosis is not a fatal disease. Only two studies used a model with variable health states and corresponding disability weights. The rest used a simplified singular health state approach. Wide variation was seen in the duration chosen for brucellosis, ranging from 2 weeks to 4.5 years, irrespective of the whether a chronic state was included.


Conclusion
Available brucellosis burden of disease assessments vary widely in their methodology and assumptions. Further research is needed to better characterize the clinical course of brucellosis and to estimate case-fatality rates. Additionally, reporting of methodological choices should be improved to enhance transparency and comparability of estimates. These steps will increase the value of these estimates for policy makers.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/77777,methodological choice brucellosis burden disease assessment systematic review background foodborne zoonotic disease brucellosis present many challenge public health economic welfare increasingly researcher public health institute use life year dalys generate comprehensive comparison population health impact condition dalys calculation however entail number methodological choice assumption data gap uncertainty accommodate thisreview identifies existing brucellosis burden disease study analyzes methodological choice assumption uncertainty support global burden animal disease programme development systematic methodology describe impact animal disease society including human health finding systematic search brucellosis burden disease calculation conducted international grey literature database using standardized reporting framework evaluated estimate variety key methodological assumption necessary compute daly fourteen study satisfied inclusion criterion human brucellosis quantification dalys one study reported estimate global level rest national subnational assessment data regarding different methodological choice extracted including detailed assessment adopted disease model study retrieved brucellosis epidemiological data administrative registry incidence data often estimated basis test not study included mortality estimate year life lost assessment due lack data assumption brucellosis not fatal disease two study used model variable health state corresponding disability weight rest used simplified singular health state approach wide variation seen duration chosen brucellosis ranging week year irrespective whether chronic state included conclusion available brucellosis burden disease assessment vary widely methodology assumption research needed better characterize clinical course brucellosis estimate rate additionally reporting methodological choice should improved enhance transparency comparability estimate step increase value estimate policy maker,16

Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 84 rheumatologists (or internal medicine physicians) and 40 dermatologists in different countries (the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the USA). Physicians were asked to identify key steps in the patient pathway relating to patient presentation, diagnosis and referral, in addition to other treatment and follow-up processes.
Results: The interviewed physicians reported that late presentation with dcSSc was common, with some patients presenting to primary care physicians after symptoms had persisted for up to 1 year. Awareness of dcSSc is reported to vary widely among primary care physicians. Final diagnosis, generally following guideline-based recommendations, was by rheumatologists in most cases (or internal medicine physicians in France) and they remained responsible for global patient management, with lesser involvement in diagnosis and management by dermatologists. Specialist centres were not well defined and did not exist in all countries.
Conclusion: Patients and primary healthcare providers can be unaware of the symptoms of dcSSc, therefore presentation and referral to specialist care are often late. Thus, improved awareness among patients and primary care physicians is necessary to facilitate earlier referral and diagnosis. Once referred, more consistent use of the modified Rodnan skin score at diagnosis and follow-up may help to monitor disease progression.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:218003,Nano dimensions/adjuvants in COVID-19 vaccines,"A favorable outcome of the COVID-19 crisis might be achieved with massive vaccination. The proposed vaccines contain several different vaccine active principles (VAP), such as inactivated virus, antigen, mRNA, and DNA, which are associated with either standard adjuvants or nanomaterials (NM) such as liposomes in Moderna's and BioNTech/Pfizer's vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine adjuvants may be chosen among liposomes or other types of NM composed for example of graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, micelles, exosomes, membrane vesicles, polymers, or metallic NM, taking inspiration from cancer nano-vaccines, whose adjuvants may share some of their properties with those of viral vaccines. The mechanisms of action of nano-adjuvants are based on the facilitation by NM of targeting certain regions of immune interest such as the mucus, lymph nodes, and zones of infection or blood irrigation, the possible modulation of the type of attachment of the VAP to NM, in particular VAP positioning on the NM external surface to favor VAP presentation to antigen presenting cells (APC) or VAP encapsulation within NM to prevent VAP degradation, and the possibility to adjust the nature of the immune response by tuning the physico-chemical properties of NM such as their size, surface charge, or composition. The use of NM as adjuvants or the presence of nano-dimensions in COVID-19 vaccines does not only have the potential to improve the vaccine benefit/risk ratio, but also to reduce the dose of vaccine necessary to reach full efficacy. It could therefore ease the overall spread of COVID-19 vaccines within a sufficiently large portion of the world population to exit the current crisis.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/78157,nano vaccine favorable outcome crisis might achieved massive vaccination proposed vaccine contain several different vaccine active principle vap inactivated virus antigen mrna dna associated either standard adjuvant nanomaterials nm liposome moderna vaccine vaccine adjuvant may chosen among liposome type nm composed example graphene oxide carbon nanotube micelle exosomes membrane vesicle polymer metallic nm taking inspiration cancer whose adjuvant may share property viral vaccine mechanism action based facilitation nm targeting certain region immune interest mucus lymph node zone infection blood irrigation possible modulation type attachment vap nm particular vap positioning nm external surface favor vap presentation antigen presenting cell apc vap encapsulation within nm prevent vap degradation possibility adjust nature immune response tuning property nm size surface charge composition use nm adjuvant presence vaccine not potential improve vaccine ratio also reduce dose vaccine necessary reach full efficacy could therefore ease overall spread vaccine within sufficiently large portion world population exit current crisis,0

Towards an epistemology of co-infection,"Tuberculosis and HIV co-infection came to figure as one of the major global health problems at the beginning of the twenty-first century, with multiple attempts to tackle this intricate issue on epidemiological, clinical, and public health levels. In this article, we propose thinking beyond the practical problems caused by co-infections in order to explore medicine’s epistemological attachment to the idea of single diseases, using TB/HIV as an analytical lever. We retrace how TB/HIV co-infection has been problematised in public health discourses since the 1990s, particularly in WHO reports and international public health journals, and show that it has been mainly discussed as a complex biosocial phenomenon in need of more resources. The epistemological interrogation of the concept of co-infection itself – as an entangled object of two or more diseases with different histories and social, political, and scientific identities – is largely missing. To elaborate on this gap, we look at the translational processes between the two diseases and their communities, and suggest concrete historical and ethnographic entry points for future research on this global health phenomenon.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/203378,double trouble towards epistemology tuberculosis hiv came figure one major global health problem beginning century multiple attempt tackle intricate issue epidemiological clinical public health level article propose thinking beyond practical problem caused order explore medicine epistemological attachment idea single disease using analytical lever retrace problematised public health discourse since particularly report international public health journal show mainly discussed complex biosocial phenomenon need resource epistemological interrogation concept entangled object two disease different history social political scientific identity largely missing elaborate gap look translational process two disease community suggest concrete historical ethnographic entry point future research global health phenomenon,16

Children's spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) is related to numerical skills. This study aimed to examine (1) the developmental trajectory of SFON and (2) the interrelations between SFON and early numerical skills at pre-school as well as their influence on arithmetical skills at school.

METHOD

Overall, 1868 German pre-school children were repeatedly assessed until second grade. Nonverbal intelligence, visual attention, visuospatial working memory, SFON and numerical skills were assessed at age five (M = 63 months, Time 1) and age six (M = 72 months, Time 2), and arithmetic was assessed at second grade (M = 95 months, Time 3).

RESULTS

SFON increased significantly during pre-school. Path analyses revealed interrelations between SFON and several numerical skills, except number knowledge. Magnitude estimation and basic calculation skills (Time 1 and Time 2), and to a small degree number knowledge (Time 2), contributed directly to arithmetic in second grade. The connection between SFON and arithmetic was fully mediated by magnitude estimation and calculation skills at pre-school.

CONCLUSION

Our results indicate that SFON first and foremost influences deeper understanding of numerical concepts at pre-school and-in contrast to previous findings -affects only indirectly children's arithmetical development at school.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/84993,count child spontaneous focusing numerosity development arithmetical skill school background child spontaneous focusing numerosity sfon related numerical skill study aimed examine developmental trajectory sfon interrelation sfon early numerical skill well influence arithmetical skill school method overall german child repeatedly assessed second grade nonverbal intelligence visual attention visuospatial working memory sfon numerical skill assessed age five month time age six month time arithmetic assessed second grade month time result sfon increased significantly path analysis revealed interrelation sfon several numerical skill except number knowledge magnitude estimation basic calculation skill time time small degree number knowledge time contributed directly arithmetic second grade connection sfon arithmetic fully mediated magnitude estimation calculation skill conclusion result indicate sfon first foremost influence deeper understanding numerical concept contrast previous finding indirectly child arithmetical development school,4

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:77777,Computer-based multisensory learning in children with developmental dyslexia,"PURPOSE: Several attempts have been made to remediate developmental dyslexia using various training environments. Based on the well-known retrieval structure model, the memory strength of phonemes and graphemes should be strengthened by visual and auditory associations between graphemes and phonemes. Using specifically designed training software, we examined whether establishing a multitude of visuo-auditory associations might help to mitigate writing errors in children with developmental dyslexia.

METHODS: Forty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 carefully matched normal reading children performed a computer-based writing training (15-20 minutes 4 days a week) for three months with the aim to recode a sequential textual input string into a multi-sensory representation comprising visual and auditory codes (including musical tones). The study included four matched groups: a group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=20) and a control group (n=18) practiced with the training software in the first period (3 months, 15-20 minutes 4 days a week), while a second group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=23) (waiting group) and a second control group (n=19) received no training during the first period. In the second period the children with developmental dyslexia and controls who did not receive training during the first period now took part in the training.

RESULTS: Children with developmental dyslexia who did not perform computer-based training during the first period hardly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 0-9%), the dyslexic children receiving training strongly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 19-35%). The group who did the training during the second period also revealed improvement of writing skills (post-pre improvement of 27-35%). Interestingly, we noticed a strong transfer from trained to non-trained words in that the children who underwent the training were also better able to write words correctly that were not part of the training software. In addition, even non-impaired readers and writers (controls) benefited from this training.

CONCLUSION: Three-month of visual-auditory multimedia training strongly improved writing skills in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children. Thus, according to the retrieval structure model, multi-sensory training using visual and auditory cues enhances writing performance in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/233001,multisensory learning child developmental dyslexia purpose several attempt made remediate developmental dyslexia using various training environment based retrieval structure model memory strength phoneme grapheme should strengthened visual auditory association grapheme phoneme using specifically designed training software examined whether establishing multitude association might help mitigate writing error child developmental dyslexia method child developmental dyslexia carefully matched normal reading child performed writing training minute day week three month aim recode sequential textual input string representation comprising visual auditory code including musical tone study included four matched group group child developmental dyslexia control group practiced training software first period month minute day week second group child developmental dyslexia waiting group second control group received no training first period second period child developmental dyslexia control not receive training first period took part training result child developmental dyslexia not perform training first period hardly improved writing skill improvement dyslexic child receiving training strongly improved writing skill improvement group training second period also revealed improvement writing skill improvement interestingly noticed strong transfer trained word child underwent training also better able write word correctly not part training software addition even reader writer control benefited training conclusion multimedia training strongly improved writing skill child developmental dyslexia child thus according retrieval structure model training using visual auditory cue enhances writing performance child developmental dyslexia child,4

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:97368,Coarse neural tuning for print peaks when children learn to read,"Adult readers exhibit increased fast N1 activity to wordlike strings in their event-related brain potential. This increase has been linked to visual expertise for print, implying a protracted monotonic development. We investigated the development of coarse neural tuning for print by studying children longitudinally before and after learning to read, and comparing them to skilled adults. The coarse N1 tuning, which had been absent in nonreading kindergarten children, emerged in less than 2 years after the same children had mastered basic reading skills in 2nd grade. The N1 became larger for words than symbol strings in every child, and this coarse tuning was stronger for faster readers. Fast brain processes thus specialize rapidly for print when children learn to read, and play an important functional role in the fluency of early reading. Comparing 2nd graders with adults revealed a further decrease of the coarse N1 tuning in adults, presumably reflecting further reading practice. This constitutes a prominent nonlinear development of coarse neurophysiological specialization for print. The maximum tuning in novice readers possibly reflects the high sensitivity of their neural network for visual aspects of print, and a more selective tuning in expert adult readers.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/75227,coarse neural tuning print peak child learn read adult reader exhibit increased fast n activity wordlike string brain potential increase linked visual expertise print implying protracted monotonic development investigated development coarse neural tuning print studying child longitudinally learning read comparing skilled adult coarse n tuning absent nonreading kindergarten child emerged le year child mastered basic reading skill nd grade n became larger word symbol string every child coarse tuning stronger faster reader fast brain process thus specialize rapidly print child learn read play important functional role fluency early reading comparing nd grader adult revealed decrease coarse n tuning adult presumably reflecting reading practice constitutes prominent nonlinear development coarse neurophysiological specialization print maximum tuning novice reader possibly reflects high sensitivity neural network visual aspect print selective tuning expert adult reader,0

These codes represent information about letters and syllables of a word. An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n = 28) or the adapted version (n = 37). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n = 37) and matched children without dyslexia (n = 25). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training.

The ability to read, indispensable to perform in today's society, necessitates a reorganization of visual cortex for fast letter recognition, but the developmental course of this process has not yet been characterized. Here, we show the emergence of visual sensitivity to letters across five electroencephalography measurements from kindergarten and throughout elementary school and relate this development to emerging reading skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in 65 children at varying familial risk for dyslexia. N1 letter sensitivity emerged in first grade, when letter sound knowledge gains were most pronounced and decayed shortly after when letter knowledge is consolidated, showing an inverted U-shaped development. This trajectory can be interpreted within an interactive framework that underscores the influence of top-down predictions. While the N1 amplitudes to letters correlated with letter sound knowledge at the beginning of learning, no association between the early N1 letter response and later reading skills was found. In summary, the current findings provide an important reference point for our neuroscientific understanding of learning trajectories and the process of visual specialization during skill learning.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/78605,rise fall rapid sensitivity letter transient specialization elementary school letter foundational unit alphabetic writing system quintessential human culture ability read indispensable perform today society necessitates reorganization visual cortex fast letter recognition developmental course process not yet characterized show emergence visual sensitivity letter across five electroencephalography measurement kindergarten throughout elementary school relate development emerging reading skill examined visual n electrophysiological correlate ventral cortex activation child varying familial risk dyslexia n letter sensitivity emerged first grade letter sound knowledge gain pronounced decayed shortly letter knowledge consolidated showing inverted development trajectory interpreted within interactive framework underscore influence prediction n amplitude letter correlated letter sound knowledge beginning learning no association early n letter response later reading skill found summary current finding provide important reference point neuroscientific understanding learning trajectory process visual specialization skill learning,4

Gender Equality Policies in Japan since 2009","After the change of government in 2009, many expected the new DPJ-led government to implement changes in Japanese society and politics. In the area of gender equality policies, new policymaking and implementation dynamics were anticipated. This paper aims at exploring the extent of policy change in the field of gender equality policies since the new government took office in 2009 by focusing on two policies that stood out on the agenda: the compilation of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality and the amendment of the Civil Code. In both cases, the prospects for policy change seemed similar, because the governing party was supposed to take up a more progressive stance towards gender equality, timing was fortunate, and the ministers in charge as well as Prime Minister Hatoyama were supporting policy change in these areas. Furthermore, lobbyists from within Japan and the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee called on the Japanese government for action. The policy outcomes, however, turned out to be very different: While the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality includes prominent new policy measures and is an example of visible policy change, plans for amending the Civil Code failed.

This paper rethinks their arguments and evaluates the current situation on the basis of fieldwork experience as a foreign woman in Pakistan in the late 2000s.

I argue that, even if the ERC’s gender approach has been introduced as part of international models of transitional justice, it is geared toward earlier women’s rights and human rights activism, as well as to established state practices of at least selectively supporting women’s rights. Like political reform in general, the ERC and its gender approach are an outcome of internal, long-time dynamics of change. Within the ERC’s politics of gender, there exists a tendency to depoliticize women’s rights activism in the process of reconciliation by making women a target for welfare measures and “human development.” Yet, at the same time, the officially recognized gender approach also allows for strategies to broaden the basis for women’s rights activism by making women’s experiences of violence during the “Years of Lead” (the period of fierce repression under the rule of Hassan II), an issue of concern in the framework of its new politics of memory.

The focus of the analysis is on discursive spaces that have been created for women engaged in non-domestic work. Starting from an interpretation of the existing academic literature, this paper argues that Pakistani women's non-domestic work has been conceptualised in three major ways: as a contribution to national development, as a danger to the nation, and as non-existent. The paper concludes that although some conceptualisations of work have been more powerful than others and, at specific historical junctures, have become part of concrete state policies, alternative conceptualisations have always existed alongside them.

We therefore achieve a consistent description of s-tetrazine from the isolated molecule to full solvation in water. The explicit treatment of solvent molecules allows for an accurate treatment of solute-solvent interactions. For the isolated s-tetrazine molecule a comparison with earlier high level ab initio calculations and other density functional calculations is made. In accordance with experiment the most favorable two-water-adduct displays a homodromic feature, i.e., a chain of hydrogen bonding from the nitrogen of the s-tetrazine to its methenyl (CH) group. Radial distribution functions calculated from a Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation of the aqueous solution clearly show an unexpected preference of water for hydrogen bonding to the C-H group over the nitrogen lone pairs. Only infrequent and short-lived hydrogen bonds from water molecules to the nitrogen atoms are found.

Biotransformation, i.e., transformation by microbes, is well understood for a number of priority pollutants, but a similar level of understanding is lacking for many emerging contaminants encountered at low concentrations and in complex mixtures across natural and engineered systems. Any advanced approaches aiming to reduce environmental exposure to such contaminants (e.g., novel engineered biological water treatment systems, design of readily degradable chemicals, or improved regulatory assessment strategies to determine contaminant persistence a priori) will depend on understanding the causal links among contaminant removal, the key driving agents of biotransformation at low concentrations (i.e., relevant microbes and their metabolic activities), and how their presence and activity depend on environmental conditions. In this Perspective, we present the current understanding and recent methodological advances that can help to identify such links, even in complex environmental microbiomes and for contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures.

We assess methodologies for projects distributing compact fluorescent lamps to households. The approval of the first large-scale methodology took more than 2 years and in the interaction with the regulatory bodies, the methodology became very cumbersome, especially regarding monitoring requirements. Four sample groups are required and the technology that has to be used for measuring utilization of CFLs does not yet exist. Therefore, project developers are not applying the large-scale methodology but try to use the pre-defined small-scale methodology. But even the small-scale methodology requires a substantial amount of data and measurements. A “Programme of Activity” approach could reduce monitoring costs through limiting monitoring to a sample of projects. Moreover, monitoring experts could be trained and thus monitoring mistakes reduced compared to single project settings.

Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of magnitude — from 0.0064 kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches used so far in such assessments: i) top–down analyses based on estimates of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches that model all components needed to sustain an amount of Internet traffic, and iii) bottom–up approaches based on case studies and generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors: a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b) whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task, while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:193890,Event-Based Angular Velocity Regression with Spiking Networks,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that process information conveyed as temporal spikes rather than numeric values. An example of a sensor providing such data is the event-camera. It only produces an event when a pixel reports a significant brightness change. Similarly, the spiking neuron of an SNN only produces a spike whenever a significant number of spikes occur within a short period of time. Due to their spike-based computational model, SNNs can process output from event-based, asynchronous sensors without any pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural networks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that implements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have not enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not only stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but also due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal nature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on classification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression problem of numerical values given events from an event-camera. We specifically investigate the prediction of the 3- DOF angular velocity of a rotating event-camera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction of angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular, asynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event-cameras without any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they provide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution, high-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on this task, we introduce a synthetic event-camera dataset generated from real-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to perform angular velocity regression.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/20642,angular velocity regression spiking network spiking neural network snns network process information conveyed temporal spike rather numeric value example sensor providing data produce event pixel report significant brightness change similarly spiking neuron snn produce spike whenever significant number spike occur within short period time due computational model snns process output asynchronous sensor without extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural network possible due specialized neuromorphic hardware implement concept snns silicon yet snns not enjoyed rise popularity artificial neural network not stem fact input format rather unconventional also due challenge training spiking network despite temporal nature recent algorithmic advance mostly evaluated classification problem propose first time temporal regression problem numerical value given event specifically investigate prediction dof angular velocity rotating snn difficulty problem arises prediction angular velocity continuously time directly irregular asynchronous input directly utilising output without ensures inherit benefit provide conventional camera resolution range no motion blur ass performance snns task introduce synthetic dataset generated panoramic image show successfully train snn perform angular velocity regression,0

Drawing on Lazear’s skill-weights approach, we develop empirical measures for occupational specificity and the skill distance between occupations to investigate how skills map into job mobility and wages. Our analysis reveals several important insights. First, higher occupational specificity is associated with lower job mobility and a longer period of unemployment. However, it is also associated with higher wages. Workers receive a wage premium of about 9% for re-employment in a one standard deviation more specific occupation. These results suggest a risk–return trade-off to educational investments into more specific skills. Second, the skill distance is negatively associated with wages. Workers moving between occupations with similar skill requirements suffer smaller wage losses than those with more distant moves.

Then, we consider the effects of a legislation restricting the maximum working time, while we let wages respond endogenously. Employment effects are sensitive to the representation of preferences. In our benchmark, small reductions in working time, starting from the laissez-faire equilibrium solution, always result in a small increase in the equilibrium employment, while larger reductions reduce employment. The regulation benefits workers, both unemployed and employed (even if wages decrease and even in cases where employment falls), but reduces profits and output.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/78505,employment distributional effect restricting working time study employment distributional effect regulating reducing working time general equilibrium model friction job creation entail fixed cost existing job subject diminishing return characterize equilibrium economy firm individual worker freely negotiate wage hour consider effect legislation restricting maximum working time let wage respond endogenously employment effect sensitive representation preference benchmark small reduction working time starting equilibrium solution always result small increase equilibrium employment larger reduction reduce employment regulation benefit worker unemployed employed even wage decrease even case employment fall reduces profit output,8

We analyse, how a decline in trade costs affects outsourcing activities and the production structure in the small economy. A stimulation of cross-border outsourcing raises wage dispersion and, if labour markets are unionized, also the employment of high-skilled relative to low-skilled labour.

The former represents the most obvious 'vertical' dimension of changing job requirements, whereas the latter, no less important in a highly segmented labor market, reflects the 'horizontal' differentiation along occupational lines. We argue that two sources are responsible for any change in the aggregate composition of skill demand: The shifting sectoral composition of the economy and the intra-sectoral adaptations related to new technologies and the changing work organization. Against this background, we assess the relative impact of inter-and intra-sectoral change on the long-term trends in skill demand.

Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment,"Employment contracts are often incomplete, leaving many responsibilities subject to workers’ discretion. High work morale is therefore essential for sustaining voluntary cooperation and high productivity in firms. We conducted a field experiment to test whether workers reciprocate wage cuts and raises with low or high work productivity. Wage cuts had a detrimental and persistent impact on productivity, reducing average output by more than 20 percent. An equivalent wage increase, however, did not result in any productivity gains. The results from an additional control experiment with high monetary performance incentives demonstrate that workers could still produce substantially more output, leaving enough room for positive reactions.

We also show, however, that this effect disappears—and even becomes positive in some settings—for formerly self-employed who find dependent employment in the same sector as their self-employment sector. Hence, the on average negative effect of self-employment is rather caused by sector switching than by the self-employment experience per se.

Studies have considered both responsive and proactive customer orientation. Competitor orientation, however, has been investigated more narrowly. Research has focused specifically on its responsive dimension, a firm's posture of quickly responding to its competitors' actions and their offerings; but has largely disregarded proactive competitor orientation, a firm's posture towards altering the market's competitive behavior in its favor. This study investigates the role of responsive and proactive competitor orientation on influencing innovation and firm performance, as well as the mediating effects of technology and learning orientation. Utilizing a unique dataset that combines primary and time-lagged secondary data from 306 firms, we find that both responsive and proactive competitor orientation are observable drivers of performance in the market, but in notably different ways. Proactive competitor orientation drives innovation performance, directly and through technology orientation. Responsive competitor orientation, instead, enhances firm performance through learning orientation. By providing insights about the proactive side of competitor orientation, this study supplements and completes the so called “market orientation matrix”.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:55861,The role of the predicted present in artificial and natural cognitive systems,"In previous work, we have argued that a sophisticated cognitive system with a complex body must possess configurable models of itself (or at least its body) and the world, along with the necessary infrastructure to use the modelled interactions between these two components to select relatively advantageous actions. These models may be used to generate representations of the future (imagination) and the past (episodic memory). In this paper we will explore some problems surrounding the representation of the present arising from the use of such models in the artificial cognitive system under development within the ECCEROBOT project. There are two aspects to consider: the representation of the state of the robot’s body within the self model, and the representation of the state of the external world within the world model. In both natural and robotic systems, the processing of the sensory data carrying state information takes a considerable time, and so any estimates of the present states of both the agent and the world would have to be obtained by using predictive models. However, it appears that there is no need for any such representations to be generated in the course of selecting a course of action using self and world models, since representations are only of the future or the past.

Under these conditions, rare mutant levellers select for hawks that acquiesce to punishment by playing dove. If these ‘acquiescent hawks’ become common, levellers outperform hawks and establish a new egalitarian equilibrium.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:86511,Structural change and the politics of dualization,"Poverty, increased inequality, and social exclusion are back on the political agenda in Western Europe, not only as a consequence of the Great Recession of 2008, but also because of a seemingly structural trend towards increased inequality in advanced industrial societies that has persisted since the 1970s. How can we explain this increase in inequalities? Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides—a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, the encompassing nature of its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. However, the extent and forms of dualization vary greatly across countries. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are not a straightforward consequence of deindustrialization, but rather the result of political choice.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/229761,structural change politics dualization poverty increased inequality social exclusion back political agenda western europe not consequence great recession also seemingly structural trend towards increased inequality advanced industrial society persisted since explain increase inequality policy labor market social policy political representation strongly linked creation widening deepening process known dualization certainly not driver increasing inequality encompassing nature development across multiple domain make dualization one important current trend affecting developed society however extent form dualization vary greatly across country comparative perspective book provides insight nordic country witness lower level divide whereas continental liberal southern welfare state likely constitute core characteristic political economy importantly comparison presented book point crucial importance politics political choice driving shaping social outcome deindustrialization increased structural labor market divide found across country government strong responsibility shaping distributive consequence labor market change divide not straightforward consequence deindustrialization rather result political choice,10

We argue that disadvantaged groups experience threats to their agency whereas advantaged groups experience threats to their morality. Restoration of these aspects of groups’ identities can unlock the potential for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups and for a greater willingness to change the status quo toward equality among members of advantaged groups. A major theoretical implication of these findings is that social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention to morally based motivations as critical factors in the facilitation of change. A prime practical implication is that interventions designed to improve intergroup relations should consider not only acceptance-related but also agency-related motivations (e.g., through a “common stigmatizers identity” re-categorization strategy).",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/218408,increasing intergroup cooperation toward social change restoring advantaged disadvantaged group positive identity article develop perspective social change cooperation advantaged disadvantaged group facilitate not redistribution power wealth also restoration threatened identity dimension argue disadvantaged group experience threat agency whereas advantaged group experience threat morality restoration aspect group identity unlock potential collective action among member disadvantaged group greater willingness change status quo toward equality among member advantaged group major theoretical implication finding social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention morally based motivation critical factor facilitation change prime practical implication intervention designed improve intergroup relation should consider not also motivation common stigmatizers identity strategy,16

Mode 2 transdisciplinarity processes are characterized as processes that relate or integrate problem-oriented interdisciplinary research with knowledge generated in a multi-stakeholder approach with the objective to develop socially robust orientations, for instance, on sustainable transitioning. In practice, transdisciplinary processes may have different functions (i.e., societal capacity building, consensus building, analytic mediation, and legitimization). Practitioners and scientists may follow different interests. And we may distinguish between different types of knowledge integration (including different perspectives, modes of thoughts or cultures). Thus, the reality of transdisciplinarity processes may become a very complex and ambitious venture whose multiple objectives are difficult to realize in practice. This paper reviews the existing challenges, obstacles, and constraints of transdisciplinary processes. This review refers to 41 mid- and large-scale transdisciplinary studies run by members of the ITdNet at seven universities on sustainable transitions of urban and regional systems, organizations, and policy processes. A comprehensive table can be used as a checklist for identifying and coping with constraints and obstacles of transdisciplinary processes in practice. The discussion identifies the main challenges for the future development of transdisciplinarity’s theory and practice, including linking Mode 1 transdisciplinarity (i.e., the relating of disciplinary causation for which no interdisciplinarity is possible by merging concepts and methods) and Mode 2 transdisciplinarity, which targets sustainable knowledge and action for system transitioning.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/124811,real type ideal type transdisciplinary process part constraint obstacle meet practice paper build theoretical foundation outlined part real type ideal type transdisciplinary process part foundation included special feature mode transdisciplinarity process characterized process relate integrate interdisciplinary research knowledge generated approach objective develop socially robust orientation instance sustainable transitioning practice transdisciplinary process may different function societal capacity building consensus building analytic mediation legitimization practitioner scientist may follow different interest may distinguish different type knowledge integration including different perspective mode thought culture thus reality transdisciplinarity process may become complex ambitious venture whose multiple objective difficult realize practice paper review existing challenge obstacle constraint transdisciplinary process review refers transdisciplinary study run member itdnet seven university sustainable transition urban regional system organization policy process comprehensive table used checklist identifying coping constraint obstacle transdisciplinary process practice discussion identifies main challenge future development transdisciplinarity theory practice including linking mode transdisciplinarity relating disciplinary causation no interdisciplinarity possible merging concept method mode transdisciplinarity target sustainable knowledge action system transitioning,16
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:94156,Agglomerationen mit nutzergenerierten Inhalten neu definiert - Visualisierung der Nordostschweiz mithilfe von Wikipedia,"Commuters have had an important role in shaping the spatial organization of Switzerland, as commuter flows have been one of the most significant criteria to delineate urban agglomeration zones. Even though urban areas and respective agglomerations have continuously gained in importance in Switzerland to this day, the Swiss national population census will no longer include commuter data at high spatial resolution. Hence, the definition of the rapidly evolving urban agglomeration concept will have to be modified for future urban research and planning purposes.
We propose a crowdsourcing approach to overcome this data gap, and employ the open and web-based Wikipedia encyclopedia as a new resource to delineate agglomeration areas. Using the North Eastern parts of Switzerland in this case study, we systematically evaluate whether user-generated content can serve as an option to fill the commuter data gap in future Swiss national population censuses to define agglomeration areas. In a second step, we evaluate the influence of potential edge effects on our chosen approach.
We employ the number of hyperlinks in the Wikipedia database to quantify the strength of functional relationships between municipalities appearing in the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Next, we visualize the extracted municipality network structure for the chosen study area. Finally, we cluster the connected municipalities to agglomeration zones, and compare the computed municipality clusters with the agglomeration areas currently defined by the Swiss census.
Our results suggest that the aggregation structure of our crowdsourcing approach is congruent with the officially developed agglomeration areas proposed by the Swiss census. Crowdsourced data thus might be an additional future data resource to complement more traditional census statistics for space districting purposes or socio-economic research in urban geography and planning.
However, our results also suggest that geographic space indeed influences even non-spatially organized, crowdsourced encyclopedic entries, and this must be systematically studied further in future studies.

Traffic events are related to traffic accidents, congestion, parking issues, to name a few. Currently, traffic events are detected through static sensors e.g., CCTV camera, loop detectors. However they have limited spatial coverage and high maintenance cost, especially in developing regions. On the other hand, with Web 2.0 and ubiquitous mobile platforms, people can act as social sensors sharing different traffic events along with their locations. We investigated whether Twitter - a social media platform can be useful to understand urban traffic events from tweets in India. However, such tweets are informal and noisy and containing vernacular geographical information making the location retrieval task challenging. So far most authors have used geotagged tweets to identify traffic events which accounted for only 0.1%-3% or sometimes less than that. Recently Twitter has removed precise geotagging, further decreasing the utility of such approaches. To address these issues, this research explored how ungeotagged tweets could be used to understand traffic events in India. We developed a novel framework that does not only categorize traffic related tweets but also extracts the locations of the traffic events from the tweet content in Greater Mumbai. The results show that an SVM based model performs best detecting traffic related tweets. While extracting location information, a hybrid georeferencing model consists of a supervised learning algorithm and a number of spatial rules outperforms other models. The results suggest people in India, especially in Greater Mumbai often share traffic information along with location mentions, which can be used to complement existing physical transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner to manage transport services in the urban environment.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/191803,exploring potential twitter understand traffic event location greater mumbai india detecting traffic event location important effective transportation management system better urban policy making traffic event related traffic accident congestion parking issue name currently traffic event detected static sensor cctv camera loop detector however limited spatial coverage high maintenance cost especially developing region hand web ubiquitous mobile platform people act social sensor sharing different traffic event along location investigated whether twitter social medium platform useful understand urban traffic event tweet india however tweet informal noisy containing vernacular geographical information making location retrieval task challenging far author used geotagged tweet identify traffic event accounted sometimes le recently twitter removed precise geotagging decreasing utility approach address issue research explored ungeotagged tweet could used understand traffic event india developed novel framework not categorize traffic related tweet also extract location traffic event tweet content greater mumbai result show svm based model performs best detecting traffic related tweet extracting location information hybrid georeferencing model consists supervised learning algorithm number spatial rule outperforms model result suggest people india especially greater mumbai often share traffic information along location mention used complement existing physical transport infrastructure manner manage transport service urban environment,11

In this study we screened 5000 mini-Tn5 transposon insertion mutants of Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 for loss of cadmium tolerance. Of the four genes identified three affected outer membrane biogenesis and integrity or DNA repair. The fourth gene, BCAE0587, encoded a P1-type ATPase belonging to the CadA family of HM exporters. CadA-deficient strains lost the ability to grow in the presence of cadmium, zinc and lead, whereas resistance to nickel, copper and cobalt was not affected. Expression studies using a transcriptional fusion of the cadA promoter to gfp confirmed this specificity, as induction was only observed in presence of cadmium, zinc and lead. The promoter activity was found to be highest at neutral pH with an activation threshold of 30 nM cadmium.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:199053,Comparison of Small Molecule Biotransformation Half-Lives between Activated Sludge and Soil: Opportunities for Read-Across?,"Compartment-specific degradation half-lives are essential pieces of information in the regulatory risk assessment of synthetic chemicals. However, their measurement according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly. Despite the obvious ecological and economic benefits of knowing environmental degradability as early as possible, its consideration in the early phases of rational chemical design is therefore challenging. Here, we explore the possibility to use half-lives determined in highly time- and work-efficient biotransformation experiments with activated sludge and mixtures of chemicals to predict soil half-lives from regulatory simulation studies. We experimentally determined half-lives for 52 structurally diverse agrochemical active ingredients in batch reactors with three concentrations of the same activated sludge. We then developed bi- and multivariate models for predicting half-lives in soil by regressing the experimentally determined half-lives in activated sludge against average soil half-lives of the same chemicals extracted from regulatory data. The models differed in how we accounted for sorption-related bioavailability differences in soil and activated sludge. The best-performing models exhibited good coefficients of determination (R2 of around 0.8) and low average errors (<factor of 3 in half-life predictions) and were robust in cross-validation. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that it may indeed be possible to read across from half-lives determined in highly efficient biotransformation experiments in activated sludge to soil half-lives, which are obtained from much more work- and resource-intense regulatory studies, and that these predictions are clearly superior to predictions based on the output of BIOWIN, a publicly available quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) model.

This article presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment comparison of four different lighting technologies: the tungsten lamp, the halogen lamp, the conventional fluorescent lamp and the compact fluorescent lamp. Taking advantage of the most up-to-date life cycle inventory database available (ecoinvent data version 2.01), all life cycle phases were assessed and the sensitivity of the results for varying assumptions analysed: different qualities of compact fluorescent lamps (production phase), different electricity mixes (use phase), and endof- life scenarios for WEEE recycling versus municipal solid waste incineration (disposal phase). A functional unit of “one hour of lighting” was defined and the environmental burdens for the whole life cycle for all four lamp types were calculated, showing a clearly lower impact for the two gas-discharge lamps, i.e. the fluorescent and the compact fluorescent lamp. Differences in the product quality of the compact fluorescent lamps reveal to have only a very small effect on the overall environmental performance of this lamp type; a decline of the actual life time of this lamp type doesn't result in a change of the rank order of the results of the here examined four lamp types. It was also shown that the environmental break-even point of the gasdischarge lamps is reached long before the end of their expected life-span.

Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life-extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/49345,environmental lmplications service life extension mobile device number mobile device mieds growing producing mieds requires resource energy cause considerable emission extending service life mieds could significantly reduce demand new device associated environmental impact however whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impact associated mieds still uncertain first available life cycle assessment mieds suggest production integrated circuit ic account majority ghg emission production phase greenhouse gas emission increase size device importantly storage capacity however little information available mied specific component logic memory type integrated circuit order quantify environmental impact service life extension mieds new approach life cycle inventory modelling modular modelling required second service measure subject rebound effect occur number device produced not fall expected effect depend consumer behaviour effect rationality involved economic actor thus environmental behavioural economic aspect tobe taken account order develop service measure entail environmental benefit economically viable appealing consumer,12

While core positions have not altered substantially, the way they were presented and supported at the international level reveals major changes. In particular between 2007 and 2011, India's international climate policy shifted from defensive, pure distributive strategies toward mixed strategies with a number of ‘value-creating’ elements, dynamism and flexibility became clearly visible in India's international climate policy. This shift is confirmed by evidence from a novel dataset based on an assessment of country submissions at the UNFCCC negotiations, negotiation summaries and interviews with an Indian delegate and representatives of other delegations. India's change in strategy appears to be driven by several factors: developments in the national political landscape whereby the personality of the delegation leader and minister in charge plays a critical role, a general trend related to rising public awareness of India's vulnerability to climate change, increasing domestic energy constraints, direct economic benefits from the Kyoto Protocol's market mechanisms, reactions to international pressure from other developing countries, and increased reporting by domestic media.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/130103,india emerging power international climate negotiation india negotiation strategy international climate policy considerably changed past decade core position not altered substantially way presented supported international level reveals major change particular india international climate policy shifted defensive pure distributive strategy toward mixed strategy number element dynamism flexibility became clearly visible india international climate policy shift confirmed evidence novel dataset based assessment country submission unfccc negotiation negotiation summary interview indian delegate representative delegation india change strategy appears driven several factor development national political landscape whereby personality delegation leader minister charge play critical role general trend related rising public awareness india vulnerability climate change increasing domestic energy constraint direct economic benefit kyoto protocol market mechanism reaction international pressure developing country increased reporting domestic medium,13

How voters respond and what that means,"This paper examines whether voters’ experience of extreme weather events such as flooding increases voting in favor of climate protection measures. While the large majority of individuals do not hold consistent opinions on climate issues, we argue that the experience of natural disasters can prime voters on climate change and affect political behavior. Using micro-level geospatial data on natural disasters, we exploit referendum votes in Switzerland, which allows us to obtain a behavioral rather than attitudinal measure of support for policies tackling climate change. Our findings indicate a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood: vote-share supporting pro-climate policies can increase by 20 percent.

There are more than 2000 sites along the coast of Brazil that range in age from 8,720 to 985 cal BP. Here, we studied the ichthyoarchaeological remains (i.e., cranial/postcranial bones, otoliths, and teeth, among others) at 13 shellmounds on the southern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are located in coastal landscapes, including a sandy plain with coastal lagoons, rocky islands, islets and rocky bays. We identified patterns of similarity between shellmounds based on fish diversity, the ages of the assemblages, littoral geomorphology and prehistoric fisheries. Our new radiocarbon dating, based on otolith samples, was used for fishery characterization over time. A taxonomical study of the ichthyoarchaeological remains includes a diversity of 97 marine species, representing 37% of all modern species (i.e., 265 spp.) that have been documented along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This high fish diversity recovered from the shellmounds is clear evidence of well-developed prehistoric fishery activity that targeted sharks, rays and finfishes in a productive area influenced by coastal marine upwelling. The presence of adult and neonate shark, especially oceanic species, is here interpreted as evidence of prehistoric fisheries capacity for exploitation and possibly overexploitation in nursery areas. Various tools and strategies were used to capture finfish in seasonal fisheries, over rocky reef bottoms and in sandy littoral environments. Massive catches of whitemouth croaker, main target dermersal species of South Atlantic coast, show evidence of a reduction in body size of approximately 28% compared with modern fisheries.

This study determines changes in benthic community following this bleaching event at a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Indian Ocean. Aldabra Atoll offers a rare opportunity to study global impacts in the absence of local anthropogenic stressors. Analysis of satellite-derived temperature data indicated that Aldabra was exposed to the highest bleaching-risk intensity of the past 20 years during this bleaching event. Bleaching-risk conditions lasted from December 2015 to June 2016 close to the 4 °C-week threshold, when bleaching is expected. Benthic cover was established pre- and post-bleaching from 21 transects across two reef locations (lagoonal reef, 2 m depth; seaward reef, 5 and 15 m depth). From a pre-bleaching benthic community in which living corals and epilithic algal matrix (EAM) predominated, Aldabra’s reefs switched to an EAM-dominated community 8 months after bleaching. Soft corals declined by 93% of their overall pre-bleaching cover to \ 1%. Although overall hard-coral cover was also reduced, the decline varied among depths and might indicate local adaptations of the lagoonal reef, due to greater variability in sea surface temperature compared to the seaward reef. With the exception of Isopora palifera, all taxomorphic coral groups experienced a decline following bleaching. Overall, Rhytisma experienced a near-complete extirpation, Acroporids (excluding I. palifera) and branching Poritids declined by more than 80%, Merulinidae lost ca. 60% of their pre-bleaching cover, while massive Poritids cover slightly decreased. Aldabra’s benthic community therefore underwent substantial changes following the 2014–2017 bleaching event and showed that live coral cover declines significantly even in protected areas isolated from local anthropogenic pressures.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/124678,impact global bleaching event protected remote atoll western indian ocean third global bleaching event caused prolonged elevated sea surface temperature heavily impacted coral reef worldwide study determines change benthic community following bleaching event remote unesco world heritage site western indian ocean aldabra atoll offer rare opportunity study global impact absence local anthropogenic stressor analysis temperature data indicated aldabra exposed highest intensity past year bleaching event condition lasted december june close threshold bleaching expected benthic cover established transects across two reef location lagoonal reef depth seaward reef depth benthic community living coral epilithic algal matrix eam predominated aldabra reef switched community month bleaching soft coral declined overall cover although overall cover also reduced decline varied among depth might indicate local adaptation lagoonal reef due greater variability sea surface temperature compared seaward reef exception isopora palifera taxomorphic coral group experienced decline following bleaching overall rhytisma experienced extirpation acroporids excluding palifera branching poritids declined merulinidae lost ca cover massive poritids cover slightly decreased aldabra benthic community therefore underwent substantial change following bleaching event showed live coral cover decline significantly even protected area isolated local anthropogenic pressure,15

Informed selection and prioritisation of areas for the conservation of inshore delphinids requires a comprehensive understanding of their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables. Water depth and distance to coast were identified as the most important variables influencing dolphin presence, with dolphins showing a preference for shallow waters (5–15 m) less than 2 km from the coast. Areas of high probability (> 0.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones.

For the first time, we apply non-invasive imaging methods to: document trauma-induced changes in shell shapes, reconstruct the different causes and effects of these pathologies, unravel the etiology, and attempt to quantify the efficiency of the buoyancy apparatus. We have analysed 2D and 3D shell parameters from eleven shells collected as beach findings from the Canary Islands (Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura), West-Australia, and the Maldives. All shells were scanned with a nanotom-m computer tomograph. Seven shells were likely injured by predator attacks: fishes, cephalopods or crustaceans, one specimen was infested by an endoparasite (potentially Digenea) and one shell shows signs of inflammation and one shell shows large fluctuations of chamber volumes without any signs of pathology. These fluctuations are potential indicators of a stressed environment. Pathological shells represent the most deviant morphologies of a single species and can therefore be regarded as morphological end-members. The changes in the shell volume / chamber volume ratio were assessed in order to evaluate the functional
tolerance of the buoyancy apparatus showing that these had little effect.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:20359,Water quality assessment in the Nha Trang Bay (Vietnam) by using in-situ and remotely sensed data,"The Nha Trang Bay (Vietnam) is an international marine protected area with significant economic, natural and recreational values. Considerable economic development is expected in particularly for tourism, navigation and aquaculture. However, in recent years the environmental quality of the Bay has been degraded by human activities and impacts. Even though the conditions of the Bay are monitored with in-situ measurements in a marine station, the environmental data, measured only in half-yearly intervals, are not sufficient for comprehensively assessing environmental quality at various temporal and spatial scales.
Therefore, it is necessary to seek for complementary data sources to assess, control and manage the marine
environment of Nha Trang Bay. We conducted three field trips in Nha Trang Bay at 23 stations, including 6 off-shore stations that are not influenced by freshwater from land, and measured the distribution of marine optical properties. These properties include the light extinction coefficient (K) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the surface layer (i.e. 1m depth) and in water columns. K ranged from 0.099 m-1 off-shore to 0.409 m-1 in coastal waters. In addition, light absorption at various wavelengths were used to assess the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments and primary production. Further, we collected and used spatially explicit data using the OC4 method and the method of band 1, 2 and 3 ratios of the Landsat TM satellite. A data comparison confirms a significant correlation between the different sources of in-situ and remotely sensed data of light absorption. However, the predicted values at stations with a water depth of less than 5 m are significantly affected by sea bottom reflection of, for example, mud, sand, coral reefs and algae.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:218997,Using land-use history and multiple baselines to determine bird responses to cocoa agroforestry,"Agroforests can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in complex landscapes. A key factor distinguishing among agroforests is land-use history - whether agroforests are established inside forests or on historically forested but currently open lands. The disparity between land-use histories means the appropriate biodiversity baselines may differ, which should be accounted for when assessing the conservation value of agroforests. Specifically, comparisons between multiple baselines in forest and open land could enrich understanding of species' responses by contextualizing them. We made such comparisons based on data from a recently published meta-analysis of the effects of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry on bird diversity. We regrouped rustic, mixed shade cocoa, and low shade cocoa agroforests, based on land-use history, into forest-derived and open-land-derived agroforests and compared bird species diversity (species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index values) between forest and open land, which represented the 2 alternative baselines. Bird diversity was similar in forest-derived agroforests and forests (Hedges' g* estimate [SE] = -0.3144 [0.3416], p = 0.36). Open-land-derived agroforests were significantly less diverse than forests (g* = 1.4312 [0.6308], p = 0.023) and comparable to open lands (g* = -0.1529 [0.5035], p = 0.76). Our results highlight how land-use history determined the conservation value of cocoa agroforests. Forest-derived cocoa agroforests were comparable to the available - usually already degraded - forest baselines, but entail future degradation risks. In contrast, open-land-derived cocoa agroforestry may offer restoration opportunities. Our results showed that comparisons among multiple baselines may inform relative contributions of agroforestry systems to bird conservation on a landscape scale.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:224628,Integrating deep-time palaeontology in conservation prioritisation,"Halting biodiversity loss under growing anthropogenic pressure is arguably the greatest environmental challenge we face. Given that not all species are equally threatened and that resources are always limited, establishing robust prioritisation schemes is critical for implementing effective conservation actions. To this end, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has become a widely used source of information on species’ extinction risk. Various metrics have been proposed that combine IUCN status with different aspects of biodiversity to identify conservation priorities. However, current strategies do not take full advantage of palaeontological data, with conservation palaeobiology often focussing on the near-time fossil record (the last 2 million years). Here, we make a case for the value of the deep-time (over 2 million years ago), as it can offer tangible parallels with today’s biodiversity crisis and inform on the intrinsic traits that make species prone to extinction. As such, palaeontological data holds great predictive power, which could be harnessed to flag species likely to be threatened but that are currently too poorly known to be identified as such. Finally, we identify key IUCN-based prioritisation metrics and outline opportunities for integrating palaeontological data to validate their implementation.

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species.

Global environmental change, including land transformation and contamination, is causing concerning insect diversity loss, articulated in the companion review Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions. Yet, despite a sound philosophical foundation, recognized ethical values, and scientific evidence, globally we are performing poorly at instigating effective insect conservation. As insects are a major component of the tapestry of life, insect conservation would do well to integrate better with overall biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This also involves popularizing insects, especially through use of iconic species, through more media coverage, and more inclusive education. Insect conservationists need to liaise better with decision makers, stakeholders, and land managers, especially at the conceptually familiar scale of the landscape. Enough evidence is now available, and synthesized here, which illustrates that multiple strategies work at local levels towards saving insects. We now need to expand these locally-crafted strategies globally. Tangible actions include ensuring maintenance of biotic complexity, especially through improving temporal and spatial heterogeneity, functional connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics, while maintaining unique habitats, across landscape mosaics, as well as instigating better communication. Key is to have more expansive sustainable agriculture and forestry, improved regulation and prevention of environmental risks, and greater recognition of protected areas alongside agro-ecology in novel landscapes.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:216365,"Forest management affects seasonal source-sink dynamics in a territorial, group-living bird","The persistence of wildlife populations is under threat as a consequence of human activities, which are degrading natural ecosystems. Commercial forestry is the greatest threat to biodiversity in boreal forests. Forestry practices have degraded most available habitat, threatening the persistence of natural populations. Understanding population responses is, therefore, critical for their conservation. Population viability analyses are effective tools to predict population persistence under forestry management. However, quantifying the mechanisms driving population responses is complex as population dynamics vary temporally and spatially. Metapopulation dynamics are governed by local dynamics and spatial factors, potentially mediating the impacts of forestry e.g., through dispersal. Here, we performed a seasonal, spatially explicit population viability analysis, using long-term data from a group-living territorial bird (Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus). We quantified the effects of forest management on metapopulation dynamics, via forest type-specific demography and spatially explicit dispersal, and how forestry impacted the stability of metapopulation dynamics. Forestry reduced metapopulation growth and stability, through negative effects on reproduction and survival. Territories in higher quality natural forest contributed more to metapopulation dynamics than managed forests, largely through demographic processes rather than dispersal. Metapopulation dynamics in managed forest were also less resilient to disturbances and consequently, may be more vulnerable to environmental change. Seasonal differences in source-sink dynamics observed in managed forest, but not natural forests, were caused by associated seasonal differences in dispersal. As shown here, capturing seasonal source-sink dynamics allows us to predict population persistence under human disturbance and to provide targeted conservation recommendations.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/229714,forest management affect seasonal dynamic territorial bird persistence wildlife population threat consequence human activity degrading natural ecosystem commercial forestry greatest threat biodiversity boreal forest forestry practice degraded available habitat threatening persistence natural population understanding population response therefore critical conservation population viability analysis effective tool predict population persistence forestry management however quantifying mechanism driving population response complex population dynamic vary temporally spatially metapopulation dynamic governed local dynamic spatial factor potentially mediating impact forestry dispersal performed seasonal spatially explicit population viability analysis using data territorial bird siberian jay perisoreus infaustus quantified effect forest management metapopulation dynamic via forest demography spatially explicit dispersal forestry impacted stability metapopulation dynamic forestry reduced metapopulation growth stability negative effect reproduction survival territory higher quality natural forest contributed metapopulation dynamic managed forest largely demographic process rather dispersal metapopulation dynamic managed forest also le resilient disturbance consequently may vulnerable environmental change seasonal difference dynamic observed managed forest not natural forest caused associated seasonal difference dispersal shown capturing seasonal dynamic allows u predict population persistence human disturbance provide targeted conservation recommendation,15

In fact, we find the opposite result in the setting where there is social contact between senders and receivers, and receivers have enough information to judge whether they have been treated unfairly. In this setting, we find that senders prefer to hide behind a lie and implement the antisocial outcome by being dishonest rather than by telling the truth.

Four dimensions can be distinguished in this process, related to the importance of media as source of information about politics and society, the autonomy of media institutions from other social and political institutions, and the extent to which media content and political institutions, organizations, and actors respectively are guided by media logic or political logic. Both media logic and political logic are conceptualized as three-dimensional concepts. While media logic is conceptualized as shaped by professionalism, commercialism, and media technology, political logic is conceptualized as shaped by polity, policy, and politics.

In this article, we argue that misbehaviors of organizations (the 'barrels') and their members (the 'apples') cannot be addressed properly without a clear understanding of their broader context (the 'larder').
Whereas previously, a strong societal framework dampened the practical application of the Homo economicus concept (business actors as perfectly rational and egocentric utility-maximizing agents without any moral concern), specialization, individualization, and globalization led to a business world disembedded from broader societal norms.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:49345,The neural basis of altruistic punishment,"Many people voluntarily incur costs to punish violations of social norms. Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors.",,neural basis altruistic punishment many people voluntarily incur cost punish violation social norm evolutionary model empirical evidence indicate altruistic punishment decisive force evolution human cooperation used h positron emission tomography examine neural basis altruistic punishment defector economic exchange subject could punish defection either symbolically effectively symbolic punishment not reduce defector economic payoff whereas effective punishment reduce payoff scanned subject brain learned defector abuse trust determined punishment effective punishment compared symbolic punishment activated dorsal striatum implicated processing reward accrue result action moreover subject stronger activation dorsal striatum willing incur greater cost order punish finding support hypothesis people derive satisfaction punishing norm violation activation dorsal striatum reflects anticipated satisfaction punishing defector,0

Episodic Priming May Not Provide the Answer,"Powerful people (e.g., political and business leaders) should be able to control their impulses and act in line with long-term rather than short-term interests. However, theories of power suggest different answers to the question whether the basic experience of feeling powerful decreases (e.g., Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003) or increases self-control performance (e.g., Magee & Smith, 2013). We conducted a pre-registered direct replication of the only experiment testing the effects of power on self-control (Joshi & Fast, 2013, Study 3). In contrast to the original results, social power, operationalized by episodic priming, did not affect temporal discounting. A possible explanation is the fact that the power priming failed to elevate participants’ sense of power. Thus, the null findings challenge the power priming paradigm rather than the two theories from which opposite predictions were derived. In order to understand how power affects self-control, future research may need to rely on other manipulations.",,power increase episodic priming may not provide answer powerful people political business leader should able control impulse act line rather interest however theory power suggest different answer question whether basic experience feeling powerful decrease keltner gruenfeld anderson increase performance magee smith conducted direct replication experiment testing effect power joshi fast study contrast original result social power operationalized episodic priming not affect temporal discounting possible explanation fact power priming failed elevate participant sense power thus null finding challenge power priming paradigm rather two theory opposite prediction derived order understand power affect future research may need rely manipulation,0

It focuses specifically on diachronic self-regarding decisions: choices involving our earlier and later selves, in which the earlier self makes a decision for the later self.

The author connects the scientific understanding of the neurobehavioral processes at the core of individuals’ perceptions of their future selves with the philosophical reflection on individuals’ moral relationship with their future selves. She delineates a descriptive theory of the perception of the future self that is based on empirical evidence and that systematizes and integrates the current theoretical literature. She then argues for the morality of prudence and interprets diachronic self-regarding decisions as decisions between two agents— the earlier and later selves—that belong to the realm of intergenerational ethics, which regulates the relationship between contemporary people and future generations. Finally, the author provides a moral theory of prudence based on respect for one’s agency. This theory identifies what the present and the future selves owe to one another in diachronic self-regarding decisions.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:3834,The neural signature of social norm compliance,"All known human societies establish social order by punishing violators of social norms. However, little is known about how the human brain processes the punishment threat associated with norm violations. We use fMRI to study the neural circuitry behind forced norm compliance by comparing a treatment in which norm violations can be punished with a control treatment in which punishment is impossible. Individuals’ increase in norm compliance when punishment is possible exhibits a strong positive correlation with activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These
activations are also modulated by the social nature of the task. Moreover, activation in lateral orbitofrontal cortex shows a strong positive correlation with Machiavellian personality characteristics. These findings indicate a neural network involved in forced norm compliance that may constitute an important basis for human sociality. Different activations of this network reveal individual differences in the behavioral response to the punishment threat and may thus provide a deeper understanding of the neurobiological sources of pathologies such as antisocial personality disorder.",,neural signature social norm compliance known human society establish social order punishing violator social norm however little known human brain process punishment threat associated norm violation use fmri study neural circuitry behind forced norm compliance comparing treatment norm violation punished control treatment punishment impossible individual increase norm compliance punishment possible exhibit strong positive correlation activation lateral orbitofrontal cortex right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation also modulated social nature task moreover activation lateral orbitofrontal cortex show strong positive correlation machiavellian personality characteristic finding indicate neural network involved forced norm compliance may constitute important basis human sociality different activation network reveal individual difference behavioral response punishment threat may thus provide deeper understanding neurobiological source pathology antisocial personality disorder,0
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:188938,The cognitive foundations of cooperation,"We conducted an experiment causally manipulating reliance on more intuitive vs. more deliberative behavior through time pressure and time delay. Our design uses a novel manipulation which relies on gradual economic incentives and was devised to avoid the high degree of non-compliance observed in previous experiments. The “social heuristic hypothesis,” which claims that people are intuitively predisposed to cooperate, is not supported in our data. On the aggregate, subjects are not more cooperative under gradually-incentivized time pressure. We also measured individual attitudes on social values and attitudes toward interpersonal risk, and find that both correlate with the tendency to cooperate. A detailed analysis suggests that subjects with a stronger (resp. weaker) prosocial predisposition become more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared to time delay, although the effect is only noticeable for extreme-enough predispositions. A possible interpretation is that relying on more intuitive behavior enhances individual heterogeneous predispositions, while relying on more deliberative behavior moderates them. This suggests that tendencies toward cooperation might not be universal, and rather be moderated by individual characteristics.",,cognitive foundation cooperation conducted experiment causally manipulating reliance intuitive deliberative behavior time pressure time delay design us novel manipulation relies gradual economic incentive devised avoid high degree observed previous experiment social heuristic hypothesis claim people intuitively predisposed cooperate not supported data aggregate subject not cooperative time pressure also measured individual attitude social value attitude toward interpersonal risk find correlate tendency cooperate detailed analysis suggests subject stronger resp weaker prosocial predisposition become resp le cooperative time pressure compared time delay although effect noticeable predisposition possible interpretation relying intuitive behavior enhances individual heterogeneous predisposition relying deliberative behavior moderate suggests tendency toward cooperation might not universal rather moderated individual characteristic,0

It is facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a role in the evolution of corepresentation.",,corepresentation joint action marmoset monkey callithrix jacchus behavioral coordination fundamental element human cooperation facilitated individual represent not action also partner identifying whether action corepresentation unique human also present specie therefore necessary fully understand evolution human cooperation used auditory joint simon task ass whether action corepresentation occurs common marmoset monkey specie engages extensively coordinated action cooperative infant care found marmoset indeed show joint simon effect furthermore coordinating behavior joint task likely look partner joint control condition corepresentation thus not unique human also present cooperatively breeding marmoset since marmoset monkey result suggest routine coordination space time rather complex cognitive ability play role evolution corepresentation,0

Management (diagnosis and treatment) of hypersensitivity disorders involves often intentional exposure to potentially allergenic substances (during skin testing), deliberate induction in the office of allergic symptoms to offending compounds (provocation tests) or intentional application of potentially dangerous substances (allergy vaccine) to sensitized patients. These situations may be associated with a significant risk of unwanted, excessive or even dangerous reactions, which in many instances cannot be completely avoided. However, adverse reactions can be minimized or even avoided if a physician is fully aware of potential risk and is prepared to appropriately handle the situation. Information on the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in allergic diseases has been accumulated in the medical literature for decades; however, except for allergen specific immunotherapy, it has never been presented in a systematic fashion.

METHODS  All original papers reporting epidemiological studies published in English, French, or German which reported on the risk of HA infection in workers exposed to sewage were eligible. They were identified by several methods and each original paper was assessed independently with a checklist by two people. Studies were classified according to the strength of their design. Non-eligible studies were also examined to assess the impact of publication bias. If the risk estimates diverged widely, causes for heterogeneity were assessed. A distinction was made between seroprevalence studies based on subclinical HA (defined only by the presence of anti-HA antibodies) and clinical HA.  RESULTS  17 eligible studies were identified. No indication of an increased risk of clinical HA could be found. For seroprevalence the studies with the strongest design suggested a slightly increased risk of subclinical HA with an odds ratio (OR) <2.5. Heterogeneity was considerable and precluded a meta-analysis. Considering non-eligible studies would still decrease the OR.

The management of meningiomas is challenging, and the role of postoperative radiotherapy is not standardized.

METHODS

Radiation oncology experts in Swiss centres were asked to participate in this decision-making analysis on the use of postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for meningiomas. Experts from ten Swiss centres agreed to participate and provided their treatment algorithms. Their input was converted into decision trees based on the objective consensus methodology. The decision trees were used as a basis to identify consensus and discrepancies in clinical routine.

RESULTS

Several criteria used for decision-making in postoperative RT in meningiomas were identified: histological grading, resection status, recurrence, location of the tumour, zugzwang (therapeutic need to treat and/or severity of symptoms), size, and cell division rate. Postoperative RT is recommended by all experts for WHO grade III tumours as well as for incompletely resected WHO grade II tumours. While most centres do not recommend adjuvant irradiation for WHO grade I meningiomas, some offer this treatment in recurrent situations or routinely for symptomatic tumours in critical locations. The recommendations for postoperative RT for recurrent or incompletely resected WHO grade I and II meningiomas were surprisingly heterogeneous.

CONCLUSIONS

Due to limited evidence on the utility of postoperative RT for meningiomas, treatment strategies vary considerably among clinical experts depending on the clinical setting, even in a small country like Switzerland. Clear majorities were identified for postoperative RT in WHO grade III meningiomas and against RT for hemispheric grade I meningiomas outside critical locations.

While 6 main genotypes generally distinguish the global geographic diversity of HCV, a multitude of closely related subtypes within these genotypes are poorly defined and may influence clinical outcome and treatment options. Unfortunately, the paucity of genetic data from many of these subtypes makes time-consuming primer walking the limiting step for sequencing understudied subtypes.Methods. Here we combined long-range polymerase chain reaction amplification with pyrosequencing for a rapid approach to generate the complete viral coding region of 31 samples representing poorly defined HCV subtypes.Results. Phylogenetic classification based on full genome sequences validated previously identified HCV subtypes, identified a recombinant sequence, and identified a new distinct subtype of genotype 4. Unlike conventional sequencing methods, use of deep sequencing also facilitated characterization of minor drug resistance variants within these uncommon or, in some cases, previously uncharacterized HCV subtypes.Conclusions. These data aid in the classification of uncommon HCV subtypes while also providing a high-resolution view of viral diversity within infected patients, which may be relevant to the development of therapeutic regimens to minimize drug resistance.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/38633,whole genome pyrosequencing rare hepatitis c virus genotype enhances subtype classification identification naturally occurring drug resistance variant background infection hepatitis c virus hcv burgeoning worldwide public health problem million infected individual estimated million death coming decade main genotype generally distinguish global geographic diversity hcv multitude closely related subtypes within genotype poorly defined may influence clinical outcome treatment option unfortunately paucity genetic data many subtypes make primer walking limiting step sequencing understudied combined polymerase chain reaction amplification pyrosequencing rapid approach generate complete viral coding region sample representing poorly defined hcv phylogenetic classification based full genome sequence validated previously identified hcv subtypes identified recombinant sequence identified new distinct subtype genotype unlike conventional sequencing method use deep sequencing also facilitated characterization minor drug resistance variant within uncommon case previously uncharacterized hcv data aid classification uncommon hcv subtypes also providing view viral diversity within infected patient may relevant development therapeutic regimen minimize drug resistance,0

All 53 participants underwent perfusion CT with 50 mL contrast material between August 2013 and September 2014. Group B underwent an additional standard multiphasic liver CT examination with 120 mL of contrast material (range, 70-143 mL). Image sets from triple arterial phase imaging were reconstructed from perfusion CT by fusing images from three dedicated arterial time points. Triple arterial phase CT and standard single arterial phase CT were compared by two readers, who assessed subjective image quality and HCC detection rate. A third reader served as reference reader and assessed objective image quality. The paired Student t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC), and JAFROC curve were applied. Results The mean volume CT dose index was 11.6 mGy for triple arterial phase CT and 11.9 mGy for standard single arterial phase CT (P = .73). Triple arterial phase CT showed lower image noise and better contrast-to-noise ratio compared with standard single arterial phase CT (P < .001 and P = .032, respectively); however, there was no significant difference in lesion-to-liver-contrast ratio (P = .31). Subjective image quality was good for both protocols. The detection rate of the 65 HCC lesions was 82% for reader 1 and 83% for reader 2 at triple arterial phase CT and 80% for reader 1 and 77% for reader 2 at standard single arterial phase CT (P = .4). Conclusion Triple arterial phase imaging is feasible at the same radiation dose as that used for standard single arterial phase CT. Triple arterial phase imaging provides equivalent to superior image quality and equal HCC detection rate despite the use of less than half the contrast material dose used at standard single arterial phase CT. © RSNA, 2018.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/176025,triple arterial phase ct liver radiation dose equivalent single arterial phase ct initial experience purpose develop evaluate triple arterial phase ct liver protocol similar radiation dose standard single arterial phase ct study subject suspected hepatocellular carcinoma hcc material method study consisted retrospective part protocol development n prospective part b evaluate diagnostic accuracy n participant underwent perfusion ct ml contrast material august september group b underwent additional standard multiphasic liver ct examination ml contrast material range ml image set triple arterial phase imaging reconstructed perfusion ct fusing image three dedicated arterial time point triple arterial phase ct standard single arterial phase ct compared two reader assessed subjective image quality hcc detection rate third reader served reference reader assessed objective image quality paired student test wilcoxon signed rank test jackknife alternative receiver operating characteristic jafroc jafroc curve applied result mean volume ct dose index mgy triple arterial phase ct mgy standard single arterial phase ct p triple arterial phase ct showed lower image noise better ratio compared standard single arterial phase ct p p respectively however no significant difference ratio p subjective image quality good protocol detection rate hcc lesion reader reader triple arterial phase ct reader reader standard single arterial phase ct p conclusion triple arterial phase imaging feasible radiation dose used standard single arterial phase triple arterial phase imaging provides equivalent superior image quality equal hcc detection rate despite use le half contrast material dose used standard single arterial phase rsna,0

To date, selection of patients for eEVAR is still heavily debated and factors like hemodynamic instability, fear of treatment delay for patient transfer or imaging procedures and logistic issues often lead to the exclusion of anatomically suitable patients from eEVAR. However, these adverse factors may be overcome by adherence to an appropriate (intention-to-treat) protocol employing the use of a hypotensive hemostatic approach, transfemoral aortic balloon occlusion technique (when needed), different types of devices and an appropriate plan to resolve logistic issues, leaving anatomic suitability as the single most important determinant of suitability for EVAR.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/190339,choice treatment patient urgent aaa practical tip since first successful attempt emergency endovascular aneurysm repair eevar patient ruptured aaa mid surgeon decide whether treat patient conventional open surgery minimally invasive technically demanding eevar date selection patient eevar still heavily debated factor like hemodynamic instability fear treatment delay patient transfer imaging procedure logistic issue often lead exclusion anatomically suitable patient eevar however adverse factor may overcome adherence appropriate protocol employing use hypotensive hemostatic approach transfemoral aortic balloon occlusion technique needed different type device appropriate plan resolve logistic issue leaving anatomic suitability single important determinant suitability evar,0

Several of these CMR applications (eg, function and viability assessment) matured during the past years and are now established components of a cardiac workup. Perfusion-CMR is close to this status and is already a major contributor to cardiac examinations in a growing number of expert centers. Large multicenter perfusion-CMR trials comparing the diagnostic performance of CMR with other techniques were recently reported yielding areas under the receiver-operator-characteristics curve as a high as 0.85 for coronary artery disease detection (MR-IMPACT). Anticipating a growing role for perfusion-CMR in cardiology in the near future, this article discusses the principles of perfusion-CMR and its integration into the workup of patient with coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition to a functional study, this integration is mainly composed of a perfusion-CMR part, followed by a viability assessment by late enhancement CMR techniques. The principal characteristics of these CMR techniques are compared with those of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). After introduction into principles and techniques of perfusion-CMR, some open questions in perfusion-CMR and challenges for the future are addressed. Finally, newer CMR applications are shortly mentioned utilizing hyperpolarized carbon-13 compounds in experimental models for quantification of myocardial perfusion and for real-time assessment of metabolic pathways in postischemic myocardium.

The claim is that a wage premium is contingent upon whether an ICT skill is a core component of the occupational skill set or a newly introduced (i.e., novel) skill element, thus engendering occupational inequality in wage returns. The study proposes a sophisticated conceptualization and extraction of types of ICT skills. It is the first one to measure employer demand for these skills directly, repeatedly (i.e., annually) and from a long-term perspective. Analyses are based on data from job advertisements taken from the Swiss Job Market Monitor (SJMM), a longitudinal dataset from 1950 onwards of annual representative samples of job vacancies advertised in the press and online that are matched to wage data taken from the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS). Results show that novel ICT skills in occupations do reap a wage return, whereas core ICT skills in occupations do not.

Both, quantitative job insecurity (insecurity over the continuity of a job) and qualitative job insecurity (insecurity over the continuity of valued aspects of the job) are examined. Based on Lazarus’ theory of stress, we predict that employees’ trust in their employer, perceived levels of employability and the combination effect impacts employees’ perceived post-restructuring quantitative and qualitative job insecurity. Results taken from a sample of 377 employees working in Switzerland who survived restructuring mostly support these hypotheses. In general, employees with a high level of trust in their employer and high level of perceived employability show lower post-restructuring quantitative and qualitative job insecurity.

Using data on detailed labour market biographies from Germany, this paper shows that job mobility contributes to this urban premium in wage growth. In urban regions, wage growth is higher both within jobs and between jobs. The higher between-job wage growth is driven by a combination of higher frequency of job changes and a higher payoff of moving between jobs. This finding is consistent with better coordination in denser labour markets. Further evidence shows that the gain from higher urban wage growth is not lost upon moving across regions, suggesting that a better job match results in higher human capital accumulation.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/207754,job mobility wage growth region individual wage growth higher densely populated region using data detailed labour market biography germany paper show job mobility contributes urban premium wage growth urban region wage growth higher within job job higher wage growth driven combination higher frequency job change higher payoff moving job finding consistent better coordination denser labour market evidence show gain higher urban wage growth not lost upon moving across region suggesting better job match result higher human capital accumulation,11

This was examined using representative employee samples from two regions of Switzerland which differ in societal practices uncertainty avoidance and performance orientation: the German-speaking (n = 966) and the French-speaking (n = 307) regions.

oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:191915,Core stability and core selection in a decentralized labor matching market,"We propose a dynamic model of decentralized many-to-one matching in the context of a competitive labor market. Through wage offers and wage demands, firms compete over workers and workers compete over jobs. Firms make hire-and-fire decisions dependent on the wages of their own workers and on the alternative workers available on the job market. Workers bargain for better jobs; either individually or collectively as unions, adjusting wage demands upward/downward depending on whether they are currently employed/unemployed. We show that such a process is absorbed into the core with probability one in finite time. Moreover, within the core, allocations are selected that are characterized by surplus splitting according to a bargaining solution such that (i) firms and workforce share total revenue according to relative bargaining strengths, and (ii) workers receive equal workforce shares above their individual outside options. These results bridge empirical evidence and provide a rich set of testable predictions.",https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/48226,core stability core selection decentralized labor matching market propose dynamic model decentralized matching context competitive labor market wage offer wage demand firm compete worker worker compete job firm make decision dependent wage worker alternative worker available job market worker bargain better job either individually collectively union adjusting wage demand depending whether currently show process absorbed core probability one finite time moreover within core allocation selected characterized surplus splitting according bargaining solution firm workforce share total revenue according relative bargaining strength ii worker receive equal workforce share individual outside option result bridge empirical evidence provide rich set testable prediction,0
