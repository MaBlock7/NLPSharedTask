We investigate relationships between policy changes, subsidy programs, agricultural practices, and water quality indicators to understand their interconnectedness and causality. Our analysis reveals that agricultural subsidies have substantial environmental impacts, both positive and negative, varying depending on factors such as implementation mechanisms, type of crop incentivized, and regional contexts. In particular, our estimates suggest that subsidies encouraging more sustainable land use practices lead to reductions in nitrogen pollution levels by up to 30 . However, unintended consequences arise from subsidies primarily aimed at increasing crop yield or benefiting specific groups of farmers, which can exacerbate eutrophication effects and degrade overall aquatic ecosystem health.
