Previous research has suggested that cover crops can improve soil physicochemical properties and overall ecosystem functioning, yet their specific effects on soil structure remain less understood. In this context, we hypothesized that cover crops have a significant positive influence on soil aggregate stability, macroporosity, and water storage capacity due to their ability to generate organic matter inputs and reduce erosion processes. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a controlled pot experiment for one year under greenhouse conditions using four treatment groups: bare soil (control), rye cover crop (Secale cereale L.), clover cover crop (Trifolium pratense L.), and a mixed rye clover cover crop treatment. Soil samples were collected periodically for analyzing aggregate stability (wet sieving method), macroporosity (computed tomography scan), saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, and total soil organic carbon content. The results demonstrated significant differences between treatments regarding aggregate stability, macroporosity, water storage capacity, and total organic carbon contents after one year (p 0.05). Cover crops promoted more stable aggregates compared to bare soils due to enhanced root activity associated with increased binding agents in the rhizosphere region such as polysaccharides and glomalin related soil proteins.

{"text": "This exploratory study employed an ethnobotanical approach coupled with in vitro analysis to investigate phytochemical profiles and health benefits of indigenous edible plants in Sub Saharan Africa. Over a period of six months, we documented traditional knowledge on plant usage from local communities, alongside collecting plant samples for laboratory examination. The phytochemical analysis revealed a rich diversity of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and saponins, which have been previously associated with antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Antioxidant assays corroborated these findings, demonstrating significant free radical scavenging potential for several plants under study. As staple foods within these communities contribute substantially to dietary intake, our results suggest that existing culinary practices may promote beneficial phytochemical exposure relevant for local nutrition strategies aimed at enhancing food security through traditional crops cultivation and consumption. Further studies are warranted to explore each plant's active ingredients more thoroughly and evaluate their safety and efficacy in long term intervention trials involving local populations.", "sdg_id": 2, "main_topic": "Plant Sciences", "sub_topic": "Phytochemicals and their health benefits", "style": "Observes and describes phenomena as they occur naturally, detailing the observed features without manipulation.", "abstract_start": "mentioning the methodology used in the study.", "length": 100}
