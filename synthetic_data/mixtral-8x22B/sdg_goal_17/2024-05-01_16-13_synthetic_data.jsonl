This systematic review, synthesizing findings from over two decades of literature, highlights both achievements and challenges within IHR compliance across diverse nations (n 194), providing critical insights required to bolster our global partnership for sustainable development. The study unveils that significant progress has been made since the adoption of the revised IHR framework in 2005 to bolster nations' core capacities for detecting and managing public health emergencies (Kandel Hsin fu, 2020). However, it also reveals that wide ranging disparities persist in implementing these regulations owing to varying contextual factors including resource allocation constraints, systemic inefficiencies, conflict situations, political will limitations or sheer negligence towards health governance (Moon et al., 2017). It is posited that these challenges undermine efforts towards strengthening health systems into resilient entities capable of averting potential crises such as pandemics. More importantly, critical gaps identified in extant data on IHR compliance necessitate increased collaboration between states and international organizations towards ensuring completeness and accuracy in reported information for informed actionable strategies (Suri et al., 2018).

The objective is to identify patterns in financial risk exposure for various stakeholders involved in international development initiatives, thereby providing insights into potential strategies for mitigation and sustainability. Methodology: Utilizing data from a diverse set of international development projects spanning a decade (2010 2020), this study employs a comprehensive methodology to analyze financial risks. The research examines project specific characteristics such as scale, location, sector focus, funding sources, implementing partners, as well as external factors like economic conditions and geopolitical dynamics that may influence financial risk levels and evolution over time. Through this approach, trends and patterns are systemically observed and documented across multiple projects. Key Findings: Preliminary findings suggest significant variability in financial risk profiles depending on sector focus, project location, partner type, funding composition, among other factors. Evidence indicates that specific combinations of these attributes influence both short term volatility and long term resilience towards financial risks in international development operations. Moreover, poor management practices are identified as directly contributing to enhanced risk exposure for many projects throughout their lifecycles. Projects that experienced reduced risk exposure typically adopted proven strategies that enhance collaboration among various stakeholders while promoting responsible resource mobilization efforts aligned towards achieving sustainable outcomes.
