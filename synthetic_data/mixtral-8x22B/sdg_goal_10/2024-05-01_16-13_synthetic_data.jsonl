Our research is grounded in a comprehensive review of existing literature on social determinants of health, healthcare access, and health equity, from which we construct a novel theoretical framework that underscores the complex interplay of individual, community, and structural factors influencing healthcare access among diverse socioeconomic strata. We hypothesize that individuals belonging to lower socioeconomic groups face greater barriers to accessing healthcare services due to various factors such as financial constraints, limited health literacy, language barriers, lack of transportation, and dwindling availability of primary care providers in their respective neighborhoods. To test our hypothesis, we employ a mixed methods approach using both quantitative surveys (n 800) administered among adult residents and qualitative interviews conducted with key stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, policy makers) across two urban centers previously identified as medically underserved areas. Preliminary results suggest significant disparities in several dimensions of access including availability, affordability, acceptability, and accommodation reinforcing the need for targeted policy interventions aimed at reducing socioeconomic gaps in healthcare utilization patterns within these areas and beyond.
