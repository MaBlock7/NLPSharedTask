This research examines coastal migrations as a response to environmental pressures, drawing from human geography perspectives to develop a nuanced understanding of this phenomenon. Unpacking this complex issue through a theoretical framework based on social vulnerability theory, we explore how demographic and socioeconomic characteristics intersect with environmental exposure in shaping communities' adaptive capacity (Eakin and Luers, 2006). By combining quantitative and qualitative data from case studies in North America and Southeast Asia, our findings reveal how community perceptions, access to resources, governance structures, and equity concerns mediate decisions regarding retreat or resiliency strategies for populations facing rising oceanic threats (Siders et al., 2019).

But what are these health risks, and what factors contribute to them? This case study analysis delves into this critical issue by examining a specific marine pollution incident caused by industrial waste disposal into local waters near a coastal community in Southeast Asia. Our interdisciplinary research team draws from medical, ecotoxicology, environmental science, and public health perspectives to establish a comprehensive understanding of how pollutants affected both ecosystems and inhabitants' wellbeing over an eleven year period.
