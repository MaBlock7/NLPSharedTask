Our analysis revealed that different dimensions of climate change beliefs differentially predict policy support, underscoring the importance of considering multiple aspects of such beliefs when developing policies or communicating about climate change. Specifically, beliefs pertaining to attribution (whether climate change is human caused) and perceived severity were found to be significant predictors for supporting adaptation policies, whereas beliefs related to scientific agreement (consensus among scientists) demonstrated stronger associations with support for mitigation policies. Interestingly, our findings also indicated that belief in a warming world was not always enough individuals who recognized ongoing climate change but did not perceive it as detrimental were less likely to endorse relevant policies. This research contributes valuable insights for shaping effective communication strategies and policies that resonate with diverse belief systems about climate change, thereby advancing our capacity to take urgent action against this pressing global issue.", "sdg_id": 13, "main_topic": "Behavioral Science", "sub_topic": "Influence of climate change beliefs on policy support", "style": "Investigates relationships between variables to assess the strength and direction of associations.", "abstract_start": "highlighting the significance or novelty about the research.", "length": 160}

The objective is to understand how social norms, particularly descriptive and injunctive norms, influence the adoption of energy efficient behaviors among households. A mixed methods approach was employed, combining semi structured interviews with households in three different neighborhood types (low, medium, and high energy efficiency) and a subsequent survey targeting a broader population from these communities. The results indicate that social norms indeed play a significant role in shaping energy consumption habits. In neighborhoods with high energy efficiency, pro environmental behavior is perceived as a strong social norm, leading to lower overall energy consumption. Conversely, weaker pro environmental norms are observed in neighborhoods with low energy efficiency. Moreover, findings suggest that injunctive norms (those based on perceived expectations from others) have a stronger association with energy efficient behavior than descriptive norms (based on perceptions of what others do). These insights highlight the importance of understanding social norm dynamics for developing tailored interventions aimed at promoting sustainable energy consumption practices at community levels, thus potentially mitigating climate change impacts associated with excessive household energy use.", "sdg_id": 13, "main_topic": "Behavioral Science", "sub_topic": "Social norms and their role in energy consumption", "style": "Investigates relationships between variables to assess the strength and direction of associations.", "abstract_start": "outlining the purpose or objective of the study.", "length": 160}
