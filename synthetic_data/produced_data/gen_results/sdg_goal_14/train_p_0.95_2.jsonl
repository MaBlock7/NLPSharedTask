{"text": "This review paper examines the current state of occupational health and safety issues in the marine industry. The maritime sector plays a crucial role in global trade and economic development, but workers in this industry face unique occupational hazards and health risks. Drawing upon existing literature, this paper analyzes the various factors contributing to workplace injuries and illnesses among maritime workers, including long working hours, physical demands, and exposure to hazardous substances. Strategies for improving occupational health and safety in the maritime sector are discussed, including the implementation of comprehensive safety programs, training initiatives, and regulatory measures. The findings highlight the importance of prioritizing and enhancing occupational health and safety measures to protect the well being of workers in the marine industry and contribute to sustainable development efforts.", "sdg_id": 14, "main_topic": "Public Health", "sub_topic": "Occupational Health and Safety", "style": "Review: This style involves synthesizing and analyzing existing literature on a specific topic.", "length": "100"}
{"text": "Abstract This paper investigates the effectiveness of ecosystem based approaches in reducing disaster risks related to marine environments. Through a series of experimental studies focused on data collection and statistical analysis, the research demonstrates the significant role that healthy marine ecosystems play in mitigating the impact of natural disasters. By examining the relationship between ecosystem health and disaster resilience, the findings highlight the importance of integrating nature based solutions into disaster risk reduction strategies. The results underscore the need for policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources as a critical component of sustainable development efforts.", "sdg_id": 14, "main_topic": "Disaster Risk Reduction", "sub_topic": "Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction", "style": "Experimental: This style focuses on presenting empirical research with a strong emphasis on experimental design, data collection, and statistical analysis.", "length": "100"}
