These infections not only extend hospital stays but also increase the risk of long term disability and escalate healthcare costs, indicating a critical gap in effective infection control protocols within healthcare settings. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between hygiene practices among healthcare workers and the incidence of HAIs in three major hospitals. Through a longitudinal observational approach, data were gathered over 12 months on hand hygiene compliance rates, the use of sterilized instruments, and environmental cleanliness scores. Simultaneously, HAI cases reported in these hospitals were meticulously recorded, categorized by type surgical site infections, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory infections. Preliminary analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between adherence to handwashing protocols and the occurrence of HAIs (r 0.86), underscoring hand hygiene as a pivotal factor. Furthermore, a moderate negative association was noted between the sterility of instruments and infection rates (r 0.65). Surprisingly, no significant relationship emerged between environmental cleanliness and HAIs. This research illuminates critical links between specific infection control strategies and their effectiveness in preventing HAIs.
