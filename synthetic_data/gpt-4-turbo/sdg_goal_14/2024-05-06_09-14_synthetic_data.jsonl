This study centers on the dramatic 2019 invasion of the lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the Western Atlantic, offering a detailed examination of its impacts on local marine ecosystems and fisheries. Utilizing a combined approach of ecological surveys and socio economic analysis, our research documents shifts in species population structures and explores the consequent effects on commercial fishing activities. Our findings reveal that lionfish, predating primarily on key herbivorous species, have contributed to a disproportionate decline in native fish populations, which in turn exacerbates the overgrowth of algae and hampers coral recovery.

These processes not only construct and alter the seabed but also notably influence the biogeochemical cycles of the oceans, impacting global climate regulation and marine biodiversity. This study aims to understand the causal effects of varying magmatic activity rates and vent chemical outputs on surrounding marine ecosystems, employing a series of in situ experimental manipulations at multiple active submarine volcanic sites. Controlled experiments were conducted to track changes in hydrothermal fluid chemistry and corresponding biological responses over manipulated gradients of volcanic activity. We quantified variations in vent fluid temperature, acidity, and mineral deposition rates by artificially modulating the subsurface magma supply in designated test areas. Parallel monitoring systems recorded immediate impacts on chemosynthetic communities, noting alterations in community composition, biomass production, and trophic interactions. The results reveal a direct link between increased magmatic activity and enhanced vent fluid output which consecutively drives higher rates of chemosynthetic productivity, affecting higher trophic levels. However, these increases also lead to greater environmental stress due to intensified mineral deposition and acidification, posing potential risks to broader ecosystem stability. Thus, understanding these dynamics is imperative for managing emerging challenges in oceanic environments induced by geological activities.
