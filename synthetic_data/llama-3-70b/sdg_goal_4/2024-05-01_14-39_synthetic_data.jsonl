{"text": "Here is an abstract that meets the requirements: Can education spark transformative social change, or does it merely reproduce existing social inequalities? This question has long fascinated scholars of education, yet empirical evidence remains limited. This study explores the relationship between education and societal change through an in depth examination of a rural community in transition. Using a naturalistic observational approach, we investigate how educational institutions and processes interact with local power structures, cultural norms, and economic systems to shape community development outcomes. Our findings suggest that while education can indeed catalyze social change, its impact is contingent upon the situated context in which it takes place. Specifically, we identify three critical factors that influence education's potential to drive change: the degree of community ownership over educational initiatives, the alignment of educational content with local needs and values, and the distribution of power within educational institutions.
