Objective To examine trends in neonatal care techniques over the past decade and explore their association with neonatal outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter neonatal database (2010 2019). We examined the utilization of various neonatal care techniques, including antenatal corticosteroids, surfactant therapy, and non invasive respiratory support. Correlational analysis was used to assess the relationships between these techniques and neonatal outcomes, including mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Results Our analysis revealed significant increases in the use of evidence based neonatal care techniques over the past decade. Notably, the use of antenatal corticosteroids and non invasive respiratory support was associated with reduced mortality and morbidity, as well as shorter hospital stays. Conclusion This study highlights the progress made in neonatal care over the past decade and identifies areas for further improvement. By understanding the relationships between neonatal care techniques and outcomes, we can inform evidence based practice and policy, ultimately promoting better health and well being for newborns worldwide.", "sdg_id": 3, "main_topic": "Pediatrics", "sub_topic": "Trends in neonatal care techniques", "style": "Correlational: Investigates relationships between variables to assess the strength and direction of associations.", "length": 160}

Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of 2,500 children born between 2015 and 2018 in a diverse urban population. Vaccine uptake and seroprotection rates were assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age.
