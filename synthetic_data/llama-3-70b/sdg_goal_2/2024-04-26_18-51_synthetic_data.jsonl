However, fields with integrated soil salinity management practices, including crop rotation, organic amendments, and optimized irrigation scheduling, exhibited slower rates of salinity increase and maintained higher crop yields. We also observed that soil salinity was positively correlated with soil moisture and negatively correlated with soil organic matter. These findings highlight the importance of sustainable soil management strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of soil salinity on crop productivity. Our study provides valuable insights for policymakers, farmers, and researchers seeking to promote sustainable agriculture and ensure global food security.

By interrogating the intersections of patriarchy, capitalism, and environmental degradation, we reveal the ways in which these forces converge to perpetuate hunger, food insecurity, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Our theoretical framework posits that a more equitable distribution of labor, decision making power, and resources is essential for promoting agricultural sustainability, improving nutrition, and enhancing food security. By articulating the gendered dimensions of agricultural systems, this research seeks to inform interventions that empower women, challenge dominant power structures, and foster more just and resilient food systems.

This review synthesizes the existing knowledge on the role of soil science in mitigating climate change, with a specific focus on soil carbon dynamics and their implications for sustainable agriculture. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between soil organic carbon stocks, tillage intensity, and plant diversity, underscoring the importance of conservation agriculture and agroforestry practices in promoting soil carbon sequestration. Furthermore, we highlight the critical role of soil microbiome in moderating soil carbon turnover and its potential as a climate change mitigation strategy. Our findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in soil management practices, emphasizing the adoption of regenerative agriculture and landscape scale restoration approaches to maximize soil carbon sequestration potential and promote resilient food systems.", "sdg_id": 2, "main_topic": "Soil Science", "sub_topic": "Role of soil science in mitigating climate change", "style": "Correlational: Investigates relationships between variables to assess the strength and direction of associations.", "length": 160}
