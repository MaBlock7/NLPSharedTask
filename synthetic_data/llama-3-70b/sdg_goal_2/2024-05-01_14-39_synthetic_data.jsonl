Through observational research, we document changes in rural food production, processing, and distribution patterns as nearby cities expand. Our findings suggest that urban growth leads to increased commercialization of rural land, shifting from subsistence oriented farming to cash crops for urban markets. While this brings short term economic benefits, it also erodes local food self sufficiency and exacerbates rural poverty.

For generations, indigenous farmers have practiced agroforestry, combining trees with crops and livestock to create resilient and diverse farming systems. But as commercial forestry encroaches upon traditional lands, these intricate relationships are being disrupted. This longitudinal study examines the impact of shifting forestry practices on local food security in rural Ghana over a period of 10 years. Through semi structured interviews, household surveys, and field observations, we assess how different forest management approaches affect crop yields, dietary diversity, and household income among forest dependent communities. Our findings suggest that forests managed for sustainable wood production can also support improved crop productivity and dietary quality, but only when local communities are actively engaged in decision making processes. As global efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition intensify, our research highlights the critical role that forestry practices play in determining food security outcomes at the local level.\"", "sdg_id": 2, "main_topic": "Forestry", "sub_topic": "Impact of forestry practices on local food security", "style": "Observes the same subjects over time to document changes and trends.", "abstract_start": "using a narrative hook to grab attention.", "length": 160}
