Our analysis reveals that population structures, particularly youth bulges and aging populations, can exacerbate economic inequality through channels such as labor market segmentation, social security burden sharing, and public expenditure allocation. Furthermore, we uncover that institutional factors, including political inclusiveness and social protection policies, play a crucial role in mitigating or accentuating these effects.

Our findings indicate that feminist interventions significantly contributed to increased self efficacy, improved mental and physical health, and enhanced community engagement among participants. Moreover, we observed a notable shift in participants' perceptions of gender roles and stereotypes, as well as a increased willingness to challenge patriarchal norms and institutions. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of feminist approaches to reduce social inequality and promote sustainable social change.

Conversely, more inclusive policies can facilitate greater labor market participation and social mobility for migrants, ultimately contributing to more equitable labor markets.\"", "sdg_id": 10, "main_topic": "Law", "sub_topic": "Immigration law and its effects on labor markets", "style": "Integrates qualitative and quantitative methods to leverage their strengths for comprehensive insights.", "abstract_start": "posing a question to frame the abstract in an engaging manner.", "length": 100}

Yet, despite its popularity, the concept remains vulnerable to critique for perpetuating inequitable power dynamics and neglecting the needs of marginalized communities. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on urban resilience and equitable development, examining the intersections between urban planning, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Through a critical analysis of 120 peer reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2022, we identify key patterns and gaps in current scholarship. Our findings reveal that while urban resilience initiatives often prioritize infrastructure investment and economic growth, they frequently overlook the disproportionate burdens faced by low income and minority populations. Moreover, we detect a dearth of research Attention to the role of participatory governance, community led planning, and inclusive policy making in fostering more equitable urban futures.

Using a large scale observational dataset from a middle income country, we examine how gender influences the relationship between educational investment and labor market outcomes. Our findings reveal striking differences in the returns to education for men and women, with women consistently earning lower wages and experiencing limited career mobility despite comparable educational credentials. We also identify significant gender gaps in educational choices, with women more likely to pursue fields with lower earning potential. These results have profound implications for policies aimed at promoting gender equity in education and labor markets, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to address these entrenched disparities.

This cross sectional study examines the relationship between socioeconomic status, food insecurity, and diet quality among a diverse cohort of 1,500 adults living in urban and rural areas of California. Our findings reveal stark nutritional disparities, with low income and minority participants disproportionately burdened by poor diet quality, food insecurity, and chronic disease risk factors.
