{"text": "The spatial configuration of cities has a profound impact on the daily lives of citizens, influencing aspects such as mobility, housing affordability, and environmental quality. Zoning laws, as a fundamental tool of urban planning, play a crucial role in shaping urban form. However, the rigid and often outdated nature of these regulations can constrain the development of sustainable, resilient, and inclusive cities. This paper theoretically examines the relationship between zoning laws and urban morphology, arguing that current regulatory frameworks often prioritize segregation over integration, leading to inefficient use of resources and exacerbating social and environmental disparities. Through a critical review of existing literature and theoretical frameworks, this study develops a conceptual model to illustrate how zoning laws influence urban form, highlighting the need for adaptive, context sensitive, and people centered regulatory approaches that prioritize mixed use development, walkability, and community engagement.
