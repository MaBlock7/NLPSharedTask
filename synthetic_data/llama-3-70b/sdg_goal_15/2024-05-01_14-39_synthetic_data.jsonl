Using a combination of remote sensing, camera trap data, and field observations, we document a significant decline in orangutan populations (43 ) and forest cover (27 ) between 2000 and 2020. Our results show that agricultural expansion, logging, and infrastructure development are primary drivers of habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to increased isolation and reduced connectivity among orangutan subpopulations.

{"text": "Can reintroduction efforts keep pace with extinction rates in human modified landscapes? The alarming rate of species extinctions underscores the urgent need for effective conservation strategies, yet the success of reintroduction programs remains uncertain in the face of ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation. This study examines the interplay between reintroduction efforts and population recovery in human dominated landscapes, where habitat alteration and fragmentation can compromise species persistence. We developed a spatially explicit model integrating demographic, genetic, and landscape metrics to evaluate the viability of reintroduced populations in modified landscapes. Our results show that even with successful reintroduction, population recovery is hindered by habitat fragmentation, Edge effects, and reduced functional connectivity. However, we identify scenarios where strategic habitat restoration and corridor creation can enhance population persistence and genetic diversity. Our framework provides a decision support tool for conservation practitioners to optimize reintroduction strategies in human modified landscapes, ultimately informing policies that promote sustainable coexistence between humans and biodiversity.

The loss of biodiversity is increasingly recognized as a major threat to ecosystem stability, yet the precise mechanisms underpinning this relationship remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to explore the role of functional diversity in maintaining ecosystem resilience in the face of disturbance. We conducted a controlled experiment in a temperate grassland ecosystem, manipulating plant species richness and functional diversity to test their independent effects on ecosystem stability following simulated drought and herbivore attacks. Our results show that high functional diversity significantly enhanced ecosystem resistance to disturbance, with functionally diverse communities exhibiting reduced vegetation die off and quicker recovery times compared to functionally impoverished ones. In contrast, species richness per se had no significant effect on ecosystem stability.
