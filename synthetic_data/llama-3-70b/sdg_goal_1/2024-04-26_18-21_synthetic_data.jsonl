{"text": "Poverty and mental ill health are inextricably linked, perpetuating a vicious cycle that disproportionately affects marginalized communities. This action research study aimed to explore the relationship between economic status and mental health, and to develop a community based intervention to disrupt this cycle. In partnership with local stakeholders, we conducted a mixed methods study in a low income urban setting, involving 300 participants. Our findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between poverty and mental health, with economic insecurity exacerbating symptoms of anxiety and depression, and poor mental health hindering economic productivity. In response, we co designed and implemented a multifaceted intervention comprising financial literacy training, asset building initiatives, and mental health support groups. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in both economic stability and mental well being among participants. This study demonstrates the potential of collaborative, community driven approaches to address the intricate web of poverty and mental ill health, informing strategies for sustainable, large scale impact.", "sdg_id": 1, "main_topic": "Public Health", "sub_topic": "Link between mental health and economic status", "style": "Action Research: Collaboratively addresses real-world problems, combining research with practical action for iterative improvements.", "length": 160}
{"text": "Poverty is a pervasive and complex issue that affects individuals, families, and communities worldwide. Effective case management practices are crucial in addressing the multidimensional needs of impoverished populations. This review synthesizes existing research on case management practices in low income settings, highlighting best practices, challenges, and gaps in current knowledge. A comprehensive analysis of 30 studies reveals that successful case management in these contexts often involves a collaborative approach, combining social, health, and economic interventions. However, findings also suggest that inadequate resources, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient training of case managers hinder the effectiveness of these services. Moreover, the review highlights the need for culturally sensitive and participatory approaches that empower clients and involve them in the goal setting process. The paper concludes by identifying areas for future research, including the development of evidence based case management models adapted to low income settings and the evaluation of their impact on poverty reduction.", "sdg_id": 1, "main_topic": "Social Work", "sub_topic": "Case management practices in low-income settings", "style": "Review: Compiles and evaluates existing research to summarize findings and highlight research gaps and patterns.", "length": 160}
