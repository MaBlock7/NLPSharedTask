Using a panel dataset of 150 countries from 1990 to 2020, we investigate the correlation between climate related disaster frequency and intensity, and economic growth metrics such as GDP, productivity, and employment. Our results indicate that countries experiencing more frequent and intense climate related disasters exhibit lower economic growth rates, reduced productivity, and increased unemployment. Specifically, a 1 increase in disaster frequency is associated with a 0.25 decrease in GDP growth, while a 1 increase in disaster intensity is linked to a 0.5 decline in productivity.

Despite their critical role in responding to these events, health systems often struggle to maintain essential services, leading to devastating health consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel intervention designed to enhance health system resilience to climate induced natural disasters. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 20 health facilities in disaster prone regions, randomly assigning 10 facilities to receive the intervention and 10 to a control group. The intervention consisted of a multifaceted package, including staff training, infrastructure upgrades, and emergency preparedness planning. Our results show that health facilities receiving the intervention were significantly more likely to maintain essential services during disaster scenarios, with a 35 reduction in service disruptions compared to control facilities. The intervention also improved staff confidence and competence in responding to disasters.
