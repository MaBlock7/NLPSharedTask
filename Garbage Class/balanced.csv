Built by Europe's finest architects under the auspices of Prussia's Kings, the Zeughaus once held a collection of the nation's weapons and Prussia's trophies of war. But since its restoration in the 1950s, this eighteenth-century edifice's long sculptured hallways and high-ceilinged rooms housed the Marxist story of the German people's struggle; images of Prussian peasants, Silesian weavers, and hardened revolutionaries were arranged in glass cases, displayed upon walls and surrounded by Socialist banners, Communist papers, and early Protestant texts. Resurrected from the annals of Germany's past, these images were brought together to fashion a German history, to create the foundation for an East German national identity, and to provide legitimization for the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED).",Art,3,0,far brandenburger tor unter den linden visitor museum für deutsche geschichte mfdg entered berlin beautiful baroque building built europe finest architect auspex prussia king zeughaus held collection nation weapon prussia trophy war since restoration eighteenthcentury edifice long sculptured hallway highceilinged room housed marxist story german people struggle image prussian peasant silesian weaver hardened revolutionary arranged glass case displayed upon wall surrounded socialist banner communist paper early protestant text resurrected annals germany past image brought together fashion german history create foundation east german national identity provide legitimization sozialistische einheitspartei deutschland sed

Studie und Text,"On March 7, 1277, Etienne Tempier, Bishop of Paris, condemned a list of 219 theological and philosophical theses. This condemnation had a lasting impact on the teaching of philosophy and theology at the late-medieval universities, and many philosophical and theological texts of this time contain references to the “Parisian articles.” In the fifteenth century, probably in Paris between 1418 and 1454, an anonymous commentary on this well-known document was written, which is presented here for the first time. A quotation in the treatise De universali reali by Jean de Maisonneuve (Johannes de Nova Domo) allowed tracing this text back to the circle of this Parisian master. Apart from the first critical edition of the commentary on the basis of all seven known manuscripts, the volume also contains a comprehensive analysis of the text. The detailed discussion of philosophical and theological problems such as God’s absolute and ordained power ( potentia Dei absoluta et ordinata ) is accompanied by a historical analysis of the validity of the condemnation. The volume is completed by an appendix, which contains further texts, as well as indexes of authorities and names. Am 7. Marz 1277 verurteilte der Pariser Bischof Stephan Tempier 219 philosophische und theologische Thesen.

Yet viewers are often unaware of its presence. In this bold, insightful book, film and music scholar and critic Royal S. Brown invites readers not only to 'hear' the film score, but to understand it in relation to what they 'see'. Unlike earlier books, which offered historical, technical, and socio political analysis, ""Overtones and Undertones"" draws on film, music, and narrative theory to provide the first comprehensive aesthetics of film music. Focusing on how the film/score interaction influences our response to cinematic situations, Brown traces the history of film music from its beginnings, covering both American and European cinema. At the heart of his book are close readings of several of the best film/score interactions, including ""Psycho"", ""Laura"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""Double Indemnity"", and ""Pierrot le Fou"". In revealing interviews with Bernard Herrmann, Miklos Rosza, Henry Mancini, and others, Brown also allows the composers to speak for themselves.

Instead, it contends that Hollywood departs in important ways from the models of both the restorative nostalgia established by the heritage cinema and Great Britain and the reflective nostalgia commonly found in American literature. Using a wide range of examples from American cinema, American literature, and American culture, it considers the reasons why nostalgia occupies a different place and seeks different kinds of expressions in American culture than it does in other national cultures, examines the leading Hollywood genres in which restorative nostalgia appears and the distinctive ways those genres inflect it, and concludes by urging a closer analysis of the more complex, multi-laminated nostalgia Hollywood films offer as an alternative to Boym’s highly influential categorical dichotomy.",Art,3,0,essay argues complexity nostalgic impulse hollywood cinema inadequately described svetlana boyms particular description hollywood inducing nostalgia offering tranquilizer highly influential general distinction restorative reflective nostalgia instead contends hollywood departs important way model restorative nostalgia established heritage cinema great britain reflective nostalgia commonly found american literature using wide range example american cinema american literature american culture considers reason nostalgia occupies different place seek different kind expression american culture national culture examines leading hollywood genre restorative nostalgia appears distinctive way genre inflect concludes urging closer analysis complex multilaminated nostalgia hollywood film offer alternative boyms highly influential categorical dichotomy

The modes and forms of a cinema of attractions, which form what is here referred to as the practice of documentary display, did not disappear with the ascendency of Griersonian documentary; instead such approaches continued to inform avant-garde film. This paper examines the connections between nonfiction documentations and avant-garde film- and the resultant implications of this meeting for documentary film theory- through an analysis of the film and critical writings of Jean Painleve (1902-1989). Painleve, whom, according to Bazin, 'occupies a singular and privileged place in French cinema', informed his understandings of documentary through contact with, among others, Bunuel, Man Ray, Bataille, Eisenstein, and Grierson. The analysis of Painleve's surrealist documentary display and his extensive body of critical literature on documentary foregrounds overlooked documentary works and constructs, or resurrects, ignored perspectives on documentary film as a way of extending and revising documentary film theory and the documentary canon.",Art,1,0,griersons theory documentary film socalled cinema attraction relegated position lower form contrast description documentary form civic pedagogy mode form cinema attraction form referred practice documentary display disappear ascendency griersonian documentary instead approach continued inform avantgarde film paper examines connection nonfiction documentation avantgarde film resultant implication meeting documentary film theory analysis film critical writing jean painleve painleve according bazin occupies singular privileged place french cinema informed understanding documentary contact among others bunuel man ray bataille eisenstein grierson analysis painleves surrealist documentary display extensive body critical literature documentary foreground overlooked documentary work construct resurrects ignored perspective documentary film way extending revising documentary film theory documentary canon

But games also offer markedly different experiences, especially in the realm of interactivity. And what happens in the interface between cinema and games console or PC? Is there a merging of languages as games influence movies and movies influence games? Are some films becoming increasingly like games, and to what extent do they draw on the characteristics of Hollywood or other forms of cinema?

 Bergsonian aesthetics give art the imperative of constantly reinventing itself and have furnished a useful key to Modernism. Here, they are applied to the continuities and disruptions of the ""postmodern,"" with its hybrid, contradictory, pluralistic claims. Focusing mainly on John Barth and Roland Barthes, this essay argues that, despite the criticism's efforts to finish it off, the ""modern era"" has not ended, and perhaps cannot end until artists cease to believe they live in a constantly modernizing present. Barthes in particular validates Bergson's significance for the artist-theorist, incessantly forging writing anew, trapped by the modern era's demand for ceaseless novelty and experimentation.",Art,0,0,bergsonian aesthetic give art imperative constantly reinventing furnished useful key modernism applied continuity disruption postmodern hybrid contradictory pluralistic claim focusing mainly john barth roland barthes essay argues despite criticism effort finish modern era ended perhaps end artist cease believe live constantly modernizing present barthes particular validates bergson significance artisttheorist incessantly forging writing anew trapped modern era demand ceaseless novelty experimentation

The Iberian peninsula and Viceregal America were inextricably linked politically and culturally from the sixteenth century onwards.

A sensibility for form, shape, abstract images. And this is really what made me love these very odd films: surrealist films, abstract films, and many other types. All kinds of avantgarde films. I was very taken by them. I always felt that if I have this sensibility, obviously I’m not unique, and I would think that there would be other people who would like to see these films too. So out of this came the idea of Cinema 16 – to have a film society, a film club, where these films would be shown, and thereby do something about the independent cinema in America.

78,1bd6c3f47958cb91603dc3bd1c127f26af774c2c,A history of bel canto,"Bel canto singing was a historical phenomenon which embraced Italian opera of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It required infinite variety of sound, in particular a lyrical ecstacy, a faultless technique to dispatch the vocal pyrotechnics demanded of it, and earned itself eloquent praise as 'the singing which is heard within the soul'. Rodolfo Celletti, who has devoted his whole career to studying the voice from every historical, technical, and musical aspect, offers here a fascinating history of bel canto singing and the voice in operatic literature. He begins by discussing the links of bel canto with the operatic ideals of the baroque, and points out that the style was created as much by operatic composers and their librettists as by their executants, the singers. To this end he undertakes a review of Italian opera of the period, andtraces the development of the style in different composers and their works. There is a chapetr on Castrati - the voice par excellence of bel canto - and the art of singing in their day. The final chapter looks at the history of bel canto since Rossini, charting its death and resurrection.",Art,3,0,bel canto singing historical phenomenon embraced italian opera eighteenth nineteenth century required infinite variety sound particular lyrical ecstacy faultless technique dispatch vocal pyrotechnic demanded earned eloquent praise singing heard within soul rodolfo celletti devoted whole career studying voice every historical technical musical aspect offer fascinating history bel canto singing voice operatic literature begin discussing link bel canto operatic ideal baroque point style created much operatic composer librettist executant singer end undertakes review italian opera period andtraces development style different composer work chapetr castrato voice par excellence bel canto art singing day final chapter look history bel canto since rossini charting death resurrection

The Hollywood happy ending has long been considered among the most famous and standardised features in the whole of narrative filmmaking. Yet this overused concept is under-analysed in discussions of popular cinema. What exactly is the happy ending? Is it simply a cliche, as commonly supposed? Why has it earned such an unenviable reputation? What does it, or can it, mean? Concentrating especially on conclusions featuring an ultimate romantic union - the final couple - this wide-ranging investigation probes traditional associations between the 'happy ending' and homogeneity, closure,'unrealism', and ideological conservatism, testing widespread assumptions against the evidence offered by a range of classical and contemporary films. It defines key features of the Hollywood happy ending through detailed textual analysis and theoretical debate. It traces the historical development of the scholarly approaches taken towards the cinematic happy ending.

O arcabouco narrativo do mito perfaz-se em quatro mitemas: a) a participacao de Orfeu na viagem dos Argonautas; b) seu amor pela ninfa Euridice, que logo lhe e arrebatada pela morte; c) sua catabase ao Hades, aonde vai para resgatar a esposa dos mortos: ele o consegue, mas ao olhar para tras infringe a proibicao dos reis infernais e perde Euridice definitivamente; d) a propria morte violenta de Orfeu, dilacerado pelas furiosas bacantes da Tracia.

Orfeu, por isto, seria um heroi civilizador mais afeito a polis (e nao autor de facanhas grandiosas como Heracles ou Teseu), pois ensina pelo poder e pela sabedoria do canto (musica e poesia unidas, fundamentais na educacao grega).O carater civilizador de Orfeu transparece nos quatro mitemas (o primeiro e vincadamente epico; os outros tres sao lirico-dramaticos, conforme a riquissima tradicao artistico-literaria que engendraram). Para o momento, pretende-se apresentar criticamente as tres epopeias Argonauticas legadas pelo mundo antigo: a de Apolonio de Rodes (contexto helenistico; sec. III a.C.), a de Valerio Flaco (contexto imperial romano, de restauracao; sec. I. d. C.) e a considerada anonima (sec. IV d. C.), estudando-as numa perspectiva comparativa que problematize historia e religiao, mito (Orfeu) e sociedade, literatura e filosofia.

ABSTRACT: Orpheus (the most important ancient legendary poet) is one of the most fascinating myths of the Greek pantheon, besides being considered the founder of the cult of mysteries named after him (Orphism). The narrative framework of the myth is made up of four mythemes: a) the participation of Orpheus in the voyage of the Argonauts; b) his love for the nymph Eurydice, who is soon snatched away by death; c) his katabasis to Hades, where he goes to rescue his wife from the dead: he manages to do it, but when he turns to look back at her he violates the prohibition of the infernal kings and loses Eurydice forever; d) Orpheus' own violent death, torn apart by the furious maenads of Thrace. The general attribute of the poet who played the lyre is summed up to the four mythemes; his alluring songs touched and dissuaded animals, rocks and trees, but also men and gods. Orpheus, therefore, would be a civilizing hero more inclined to the polis (and not the author of grand exploits as Heracles or Theseus), as he teaches through the power and the wisdom of the song (music and poetry united, essential in Greek education).The civilizing character of Orpheus is evident in the four mythemes (the first is markedly epic; the other three are lyric-dramatic, according to the rich artistic-literary tradition that they engendered). For the moment, we intend to critically present the three Argonautic epopees bequeathed by the ancient world: the one from Apollonius of Rhodes (Hellenistic context; 3rd century B.C.), the one from Valerius Flaccus (Roman Imperial Restoration context; 1st century A.C.) and the one considered anonymous (4th century A.C.), studying them in a comparative perspective that problematizes history and religion, myth (Orpheus) and society, literature and philosophy.

Read through the frame of poststructuralist analysis of discourse and the philosophy of science, the procedure of the ars grammatica are interpreted as overlapping genres (commentary, glossary, encyclopedia, exegesis) which use different verbal or extraverbal criteria to explain the origins and significations of words and which establish different epistemological frames within which an etymological account of language is situated.

Initial examination revealed that it had been heavily over-restored in the nineteenth century. All these additions were removed during cleaning. The original terracotta relief was examined in great detail and this established the stages and techniques used in its construction and showed that it was an original piece of sculpture and not a copy. Thermoluminescence dating proved that the relief was made between 1416 and 1546 and a comparison of composition and style suggests that a date in the 1460s is appropriate.,Art,2,0,detailed technological scientific examination carried terracotta relief sculpture madonna child attributed school verrocchio birmingham museum art gallery since never previously examined detail although one authority dismissed nineteenth century copy initial examination revealed heavily overrestored nineteenth century addition removed cleaning original terracotta relief examined great detail established stage technique used construction showed original piece sculpture copy thermoluminescence dating proved relief made comparison composition style suggests date appropriate

117,7fcb08e5374e706b794226eecb96d3114f5535a9,Surrealism and the Cinema,"It seems it is no longer fashionable to discuss surrealism. Evidently the novelty has worn off. A movement which once provoked irate incomprehension now is the occasion for conveniently trite critical judgements, which most of us are content to reiterate. Alarm has given place to patronizing indulgence—we have persistently refused to face up to the implications of the problems surrealism raises. Of course, it is much safer to accord surrealism some undefined degree of significance, to adopt a compromising position, than it is either to con demn it out of hand or to examine it closely. And so a critic like Marc Soriano, writing on "" Le Surrealisme au cinema "" in Formes et couleurs in 1946, feels entitled to make a statement like "" The quality of the surrealist films is beyond doubt,"" without feeling under any obligation to define this quality. It would appear that, when dealing with a group who deny the claims of logic, it is quite in order to continue with an illogical assertion, unsupported either by explanation or by evidence: "" One may simply note that the words ' cinema' and ' surrealism' are contradictory."" In the light of such a remark, we are left wondering what connection there can possibly be between surrealism and the cinema. If we are to hope to make any progress, we must start at the very beginning, seeking to establish what points of contact may exist between the aims of surrealism and what the cinema has to offer.",Art,3,0,seems longer fashionable discus surrealism evidently novelty worn movement provoked irate incomprehension occasion conveniently trite critical judgement u content reiterate alarm given place patronizing indulgencewe persistently refused face implication problem surrealism raise course much safer accord surrealism undefined degree significance adopt compromising position either con demn hand examine closely critic like marc soriano writing le surrealisme au cinema formes et couleurs feel entitled make statement like quality surrealist film beyond doubt without feeling obligation define quality would appear dealing group deny claim logic quite order continue illogical assertion unsupported either explanation evidence one may simply note word cinema surrealism contradictory light remark left wondering connection possibly surrealism cinema hope make progress must start beginning seeking establish point contact may exist aim surrealism cinema offer

Lieberman's ""Some Day My Prince Will Come,"" Bruno Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment, and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic-Joosen connects the critical views expressed in these feminist and psychoanalytic interpretations with fictional fairy-tale retellings and illustrations that have been published in Dutch, English, and German since the 1970s. While readers may not automatically connect fairy-tale retellings and criticism, Joosen argues that they represent a similar conviction to understand, interpret, criticize, and experiment with the original tale. Moving through her three critical focus texts in chronological order, Joosen addresses fairy-tale retellings in prose, poetry, and pictures, including revisions of ""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" Authors and illustrators whose work is discussed include Paul Biegel, Anthony Browne, Gillian Cross, Emma Donoghue, Iring Fetscher, Ad?le Geras, Otto Gmelin, Wim Hofman, Anne Provoost, Anne Sexton, Barbara Walker, and Jane Yolen.Joosen argues that retellings and criticism participate in a continuous and dynamic dialogue about the traditional fairy tale, but on different terms.""

This theory also influenced Impressionism, which is the most radical and revolutionary movement in the history of painting, yielding modern art.

Rhétorique et poétique des passions dans la fiction narrative en prose du XVIIe siècle,"L’objet de cette these est d’etudier les changements qui s’operent au cours du XVIIe siecle dans la maniere dont les passions sont exprimees et representees dans la fiction narrative en prose. Avec le passage des longs romans aux nouvelles galantes, la date de 1660 est souvent consideree comme une date charniere pour le genre romanesque. Ce renouveau formel interesse tout particulierement la question de l’affectivite – aussi bien sur les plans stylistique, enonciatif que pragmatique. Alors que l’expression pathetique se voit redefinie par la critique de l’ornement et la promotion du naturel, les vicissitudes du roman semblent en partie correlees a celles de l’art de parler. Travaillant sur le siecle en son entier, a partir d’un vaste choix de textes fictionnels, de rhetoriques et de poetiques, nous avons voulu decrire une a une les etapes de ce bouleversement. Cette mise en perspective invite a nuancer le caractere novateur de la nouvelle historique et galante. Si le roman baroque se presente comme une anthologie de discours passionnes, on assiste, des les annees 1620, a l’effacement de la voix narrative et, par consequent, des marques d’une narration emue. De meme, le psycho-recit qui est associe dans l’histoire litteraire a La Princesse de Cleves est deja une technique narrative bien attestee dans le premier XVIIe siecle.

Vesuvius in A.D. 79, then rediscovered in 1750 contained a large collection of bronze and marble statuary and busts. Before they were published or exhibited, the sculptures were restored so as to appear whole: it is thus that they helped to shape early modern tastes in classical sculpture. Scholars have sought to assign names to the individual busts and statues and to discover a unified, planned sculptural program for the decoration of the Villa dei Papiri. Here, however, more objective questions are asked: Are the bronzes uniform enough in production technique and alloy or marble source to justify the notion of a single sculptural program?

We decided to reconstruct its original appearance with help of wood biology. We examined the following features: colour of the wood, occurrence of sapwood, heartwood and discoloured wood, presence of pith, bark and included bark, orientation of grain, texture, homogeneity, occurrence of tension wood, juvenile wood and reaction zones. We concluded that the main part of the original version of the sculpture was made of one larger piece of lime wood (Tilia sp.). The wood was taken from a tree where the stem divides into larger branches. The artist used the natural branching to make the upper part of the statue, one branch for St. Mary and one for Jesus. He also took advantage of the natural eccentricity of the stem. We found out that the original version of the statue was later put apart by sawing so that it could be dressed in textile.

154,371771656f732bd8c10c54b63f43160932d16257,Echolalias: On the Forgetting of Language,"Just as speech can be acquired, so can it be lost. Speakers can forget words, phrases, even entire languages they once knew; over the course of time peoples, too, let go of the tongues that were once theirs, as languages disappear and give way to the others that follow them. In Echolalias, Daniel Heller-Roazen reflects on the many forms of linguistic forgetfulness, offering a far-reaching philosophical investigation into the persistence and disappearance of speech. In twenty-one brief chapters, he moves among classical, medieval, and modern culture, exploring the interrelations of speech, writing, memory, and oblivion. Drawing his examples from literature, philosophy, linguistics, theology, and psychoanalysis, Heller-Roazen examines the points at which the transience of speech has become a question in the arts, disciplines, and sciences in which language plays a prominent role. Whether the subject is Ovid, Dante, or modern fiction, classical Arabic literature or the birth of the French language, structuralist linguistics or Freud's writings on aphasia, Heller-Roazen considers with clarity, precision, and insight the forms, the effects, and the ultimate consequences of the forgetting of language. In speech, he argues, destruction and construction often prove inseparable. Among peoples, the disappearance of one language can mark the emergence of another; among individuals, the experience of the passing of speech can lie at the origin of literary, philosophical, and artistic creation. From the infant's prattle to the legacy of Babel, from the holy tongues of Judaism and Islam to the concept of the dead language and the political significance of exiled and endangered languages today, Echolalias traces an elegant, erudite, and original philosophical itinerary, inviting us to reflect in a new way on the nature of the speaking animal who forgets.",Art,3,0,speech acquired lost speaker forget word phrase even entire language knew course time people let go tongue language disappear give way others follow echolalia daniel hellerroazen reflects many form linguistic forgetfulness offering farreaching philosophical investigation persistence disappearance speech twentyone brief chapter move among classical medieval modern culture exploring interrelation speech writing memory oblivion drawing example literature philosophy linguistics theology psychoanalysis hellerroazen examines point transience speech become question art discipline science language play prominent role whether subject ovid dante modern fiction classical arabic literature birth french language structuralist linguistics freud writing aphasia hellerroazen considers clarity precision insight form effect ultimate consequence forgetting language speech argues destruction construction often prove inseparable among people disappearance one language mark emergence another among individual experience passing speech lie origin literary philosophical artistic creation infant prattle legacy babel holy tongue judaism islam concept dead language political significance exiled endangered language today echolalia trace elegant erudite original philosophical itinerary inviting u reflect new way nature speaking animal forgets

The author argues that the film’s layered use of on-screen and off-screen mobility reveal the politics of transnational migration and their impact on the migrant’s body. These conventions and their ideological are conveyed to the reader through close readings of select scenes. To further achieve this, the author resorts to the notion of ‘border syndrome’, coined by Gazmend Kapllani in his Short Border Handbook and to Hamid Naficy’s meditations on border subjects in his Accented Cinema, and argues that Hostage reimagines the migrant as a tragic outsider, prone to victimhood.",Art,2,0,giannariss film provides original evocation border crossing reimagining hijacking intercity bus greece clandestine albanian migrant endured police brutality greece chapter affords indepth analysis film form thematic preoccupation comprehend issue mobility essential cinematic migrant journey author argues film layered use onscreen offscreen mobility reveal politics transnational migration impact migrant body convention ideological conveyed reader close reading select scene achieve author resort notion border syndrome coined gazmend kapllani short border handbook hamid naficys meditation border subject accented cinema argues hostage reimagines migrant tragic outsider prone victimhood

203,b41102eb01d366be3b1536cf8936be895baca827,"The Sculpture and Myths of Eshu-Elegba, the Yoruba Trickster: Definition and Interpretation in Yoruba Iconography","Opening Paragraph During my field study of Yoruba art (1955–7) little of the symbolic meaning of the forms and component elements of the ritual sculpture was revealed to me through straightforward answers to straightforward questions. Indeed, it soon became evident that if meaning with any degree of resonance was to be arrived at, such a technique had to be abandoned in favour of an interpretative analysis in relation to myths and praise songs on the one hand, and the observation of the use of sculpture in ritual on the other. Résumé LES SCULPTURES ET LES MYTHES D'ESHU-ELEGBA, LE FOURBE YORUBA: DÉFINITION ET INTERPRÉTATION DANS L'ICONOGRAPHIE YORUBA Les formes sculptées d'Eshu-Elegba, le fourbe Yoruba ou dieu de l'espièglerie, sont présentées, ainsi que ses rites et certains des mythes et des chansons de louanges renfermant une description de ses caractéristiques et de ses activités. Dans la société Yoruba, le fourbe est employé pour fournir une explication d'une conduite déviatrice; il constitue l'extériorisation des difficultés du conformisme. Il est également l'ennemi de la stagnation. Il a une fonction explicative dans la cosmologie Yoruba, car il témoigne que, bien que les gens soient bien informés par l'oracle Ifa, ses activités trouveront sûrement un chemin et exigeront une mise au point continuelle. Cependant, Eshu-Elegba ne constitue pas l'espièglerie au hasard, ni simplement ‘la colère des dieux’; il est également, sous son aspect positif, associé avec la productivité, le changement et la croissance. Ses symboles sont examinés et leur signification est interprétée au moyen des mythes, des chansons et des rites et aux termes des valeurs et du fonctionnement de la culture. Dans la présentation de sa nature ambiguë, des contradictions inhérentes sont examinées, et dans l'analyse de ses symboles certaines agrégations se dégagent. Il est constaté que la cohérence de ces agrégations s'appuie largement sur le principe de la redondance et que la signification d'un élément constitutif quelconque est rendue claire par rapport aux autres. Une comparaison avec les personnages fourbes dans d'autres cultures est complétée par la présentation du complexe de l'espièglerie comme il est connu aux psychologues analytiques, afin d'indiquer comment ce genre d'analyse interprétative pourrait profiter des méthodes faisant appel à plusieurs disciplines.",Art,3,0,opening paragraph field study yoruba art little symbolic meaning form component element ritual sculpture revealed straightforward answer straightforward question indeed soon became evident meaning degree resonance arrived technique abandoned favour interpretative analysis relation myth praise song one hand observation use sculpture ritual résumé le sculpture et le mythes deshuelegba le fourbe yoruba définition et interprétation dans liconographie yoruba le formes sculptées deshuelegba le fourbe yoruba ou dieu de lespièglerie sont présentées ainsi que s rite et certains de mythes et de chansons de louanges renfermant une description de s caractéristiques et de s activités dans la société yoruba le fourbe est employé pour fournir une explication dune conduite déviatrice il constitue lextériorisation de difficultés du conformisme il est également lennemi de la stagnation il une fonction explicative dans la cosmologie yoruba car il témoigne que bien que le gen soient bien informés par loracle ifa s activités trouveront sûrement un chemin et exigeront une mise au point continuelle cependant eshuelegba ne constitue pa lespièglerie au hasard ni simplement la colère de dieux il est également sou son aspect positif associé avec la productivité le changement et la croissance s symboles sont examinés et leur signification est interprétée au moyen de mythes de chansons et de rite et aux termes de valeurs et du fonctionnement de la culture dans la présentation de sa nature ambiguë de contradiction inhérentes sont examinées et dans lanalyse de s symboles certaines agrégations se dégagent il est constaté que la cohérence de ce agrégations sappuie largement sur le principe de la redondance et que la signification dun élément constitutif quelconque est rendue claire par rapport aux autres une comparaison avec le personnages fourbes dans dautres culture est complétée par la présentation du complexe de lespièglerie comme il est connu aux psychologues analytiques afin dindiquer comment ce genre danalyse interprétative pourrait profiter de méthodes faisant appel à plusieurs discipline

This book provides a critical analysis of the cinematic representation of fatness during this timeframe, specifically in contemporary Hollywood cinema, with emphasis on the intersection of gender, race and fatness. The analysis is based on around 50 films released since 2000 and includes examples such as Transformers, Precious, Kung Fu Panda, Paul Blart and Pitch Perfect. Barbara Plotz provides a mapping of the common cinematic tropes of fatness and also shows how commonplace notions of fatness that are part of the current ‘‘obesity epidemic’’ discourse are reflected in these tropes. In this original study Plotz brings critical attention to the politics of fat representation, a topic that has so far received little attention within film and cinema studies.",Art,3,0,last two decade fatness become focus ubiquitous negative rhetoric usa beyond presented cover medicalized war obesity epidemic book provides critical analysis cinematic representation fatness timeframe specifically contemporary hollywood cinema emphasis intersection gender race fatness analysis based around film released since includes example transformer precious kung fu panda paul blart pitch perfect barbara plotz provides mapping common cinematic trope fatness also show commonplace notion fatness part current obesity epidemic discourse reflected trope original study plotz brings critical attention politics fat representation topic far received little attention within film cinema study

We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First, proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation.",Biology,2,0,major pathway eukaryotic messenger rna mrna turnover begin deadenylation followed decapping exonucleolytic decay provide evidence mrna decapping degradation occur discrete cytoplasmic focus yeast call processing body p body first protein activate catalyze decapping concentrated p body second inhibiting mrna turnover decapping lead loss p body however inhibiting turnover decapping increase abundance size p body finally mrna degradation intermediate localized p body result define flux mrna polysomes p body critical aspect cytoplasmic mrna metabolism possible site regulation mrna degradation

Rathke as early as 1839 observed the continuity of the columella and hyoid arch in snakes. The comparative anatomy of the lacertilian columella auris has been exhaustively studied by Versluys ('03) and was shown by him to be composed of two morphologically distinct parts, a median segment, the stapes, closing the fenestra vestibuli, and a lateral segment, the extracolumella, which remains cartilaginous through life and whose outer end is attached to the tympanic membrane. The independence in origin of columella and otic capsule has not been recognized, however, by all investigators although at the present time the evidence is quite convincing that the columella auris is entirely extra-capsular in origin. In Lacertilia, according to Versluys, the extracolumella apparently takes part in the completion of the hyoid arch and in fact i t has been termed the hyostapes by Hoffman ('89) in contradistinction to the otostapes, which that investigator regarded as of labyrinthine origin. I n Testudo, according to Bender (,ll), the columella is united with the hyale by means of the interhyale and the extracolumella lies wholly external to the arch which is made up of the cornu hyale, interhyale, and columella.

Der Bericht Röntgens über eine neue Art von Strahlen eröffnete Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern im besten Sinne des Wortes eine vollständig neue Sicht auf die Materie und die Vorgänge des Lebens [1]. Die Anwendung von Röntgenstrahlen am lebenden Menschen war eine Sensation, die dazu führte, dass ein neues wissenschaftliches Zeitalter eingeläutet wurde. Von früher Verborgenem konnte vieles sichtbar gemacht werden. Die Medizin ist heute ohne die möglichst naturgetreue Abbildung der Erkrankung und deren Unterscheidung vom Gesunden nicht denkbar. Die Einführung des Röntgenbildes in den klinischen Alltag wurde zum Triumphzug für Röntgens bahnbrechende Entdeckung. Bilder beherrschten seither die klinische Medizin und weitere technische Entwicklungen folgten. Zunächst hielt der Ultraschall Einzug, dann die Computertomografie und schließlich die Magnetresonanztomografie [2–5]. Die Kombination von Schnittbildverfahren mit funktionell ausgerichteten Methoden der Positronenemissionstomografie führte zur Entwicklung hybrider bildgebender System wie dem PET-CT und der MR-PET [6, 7]. Die (R)Evolution der Computertechnik hat neue Methoden der Bilderzeugung, Bildnachverarbeitung und Speicherung ermöglicht. Mit dem Übergang vom analogen zum digitalen Zeitalter wurde die uneingeschränkte Verfügbarkeit diagnostischer, bildbasierter Information zur Realität. Heute stehen Patienten und Ärzten die Ergebnisse einer radiologischen Untersuchung sofort zur Verfügung. Das Ergebnis kann in Sekundenschnelle an jeden Ort der Welt kommuniziert werden. Die Radiologie und der Radiologe sind im besten Sinne des Wortes transparent. Die Radiologie ist Vorreiter und Motor der Telemedizin. Die Radiologie verkörpert eine hoch aggregierte Symbiose ärztlicher Kunst und technischer Innovation. Wenige medizinische Disziplinen sind so technikgetrieben und technikaffin wie unser Fach. Bedingt durch den enormen technischen Fortschritt sind radiologische Methoden zumeist wenig oder nur minimal-invasiv. Die interventionelle Radiologie hat durch eine immer weiter entwickelte Technologie von Kathetern, Gefäßprothesen oder Embolisationsmaterialien einen Stand erreicht, der noch vor 10 Jahren schwer vorstellbar war. Die fortschreitende Miniaturisierung interventioneller Werkzeuge trägt zudem der Forderung nach immer mehr ambulanten Prozeduren, die kostenaufwändigere stationäre Prozeduren ersetzen sollen, Rechnung. So ist die perkutane Angioplastie der Extremitätengefäße heute in vielen Zentren ein ambulanter Eingriff [8]. Die Komplikationsraten sind gering. So können kostbare Nutzungszeiten von OP-Sälen, die zum Teuersten gehören, was in einem Krankenhaus an Kosten generiert wird, minimiert werden und großen Eingriffen vorbehalten bleiben. Ein Hybrid OP sollte aus betriebswirtschaftlicher Sicht, Eingriffen vorbehalten bleiben, die tatsächlich hybrid durchgeführt werden oder die Möglichkeit der Konversion von minimal invasiv zu offen chirurgisch beinhalten. Die interventionelle Radiologie ist als minimalinvasiver bildgebend gesteuerter Eingriff mit einem chirurgischen Effekt ein Paradebeispiel für ärztliches Handeln, das den konzertanten Einsatz der Medizin und filigraner Technik erfordert. Die Universitätsund Industrie-getriebene Forschung zur Weiterentwicklung der Schnittbildmethoden ist ein Paradebeispiel für die fruchtbare Symbiose von Medizin und Technik. Die Einführung des medizinischen Ultraschalls, der Computertomografie, der digitalen Subtraktionsangiografie, der klinischen Magnetresonanztomografie und den hybriden Bildgebungsverfahren wie der PET-CT und jüngst der MR-PET zeigen, wie aus einer brillianten technischen Idee und deren konstruktiver Realisierung in enger Zusammenarbeit mit wissenschaftlich klinisch tätigen Radiologen neue Perspektiven in der klinischen Medizin entstehen. Der Blick in das Körperinnere erschließt dem Arzt nicht nur ein anatomisches Verständnis des Gesunden und des krankhaft veränderten Gewebes, sondern ermöglicht auch ein immer tiefer greifenden funktionellen Einblick in (Patho-) Physiologie und Biochemie von Erkrankungen. Die Weiterentwicklung der Technik und deren Integration in klinische Abläufe ist ein Prozess, der von Naturwissenschaftlern, Ingenieuren und Radiologen gemeinsam vorangetrieben wird. Markantes Beispiel ist die Einführung der SpiralCT in die klinische Krankenversorgung, die viele Prozesse im Klinikalltag neu ausgerichtet hat [9]. Die Versorgung polytraumatisierter Patienten, die Diagnostik von Gefäßerkrankungen oder die Herzdiagnostik wurden durch die Spiral-CT revolutioniert. Daneben hat die Methode auch zu einer immensen Beschleunigung der diagnostischen Aufarbeitung klinischer Fragestellungen geführt. Spiral-CT bedeutet Diagnostik „on demand“.

The compiler first translates the bytecode into a static single‐assignment intermediate representation on which optimizations are performed, before generating JavaScript. We believe that taking bytecode as an input instead of a high‐level language is a sensible choice. Virtual machines provide a very stable API. Such a compiler is thus easy to maintain. It is also convenient to use, and it can just be added to an existing installation of the development tools. Already‐compiled libraries can be used directly, with no need to reinstall anything. Finally, some virtual machines are the target of several languages. A bytecode to JavaScript compiler would make it possible to retarget all these languages to Web browsers at once.

The CACAO system translates Java byte code on demand into native code for the ALPHA processor. During this translation process the stack-oriented Java byte code is transformed into a register-oriented intermediate code. Local variables and stack locations are replaced by pseudo-registers eliminating the 32-bit restriction on address types. A fast register allocation algorithm is applied to map the pseudo-registers to machine registers. During code generation, field offsets are computed for proper alignment on 64-bit architectures. Even though the CACAO system has to incur loading and compilation time, it executes Java programs up to 85 times faster than the JDK interpreter, and up to seven times faster than the kaffe JIT compiler. It is slightly slower than equivalent C programs compiled at the highest optimization level. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Computer Science,3,0,paper describes design implementation cacao justintime compiler java cacao system translates java byte code demand native code alpha processor translation process stackoriented java byte code transformed registeroriented intermediate code local variable stack location replaced pseudoregisters eliminating bit restriction address type fast register allocation algorithm applied map pseudoregisters machine register code generation field offset computed proper alignment bit architecture even though cacao system incur loading compilation time executes java program time faster jdk interpreter seven time faster kaffe jit compiler slightly slower equivalent c program compiled highest optimization level john wiley son ltd

In doing so, we hare not been completely impartial — the programming approach has been emphasized more than the others. There are perhaps two reasons for this emphasis: First and the more obvious one is the closeness between theoretical programming discussed here and programming of digital computers. Secondly, the programming approach has provided a way of looking at automata that seems to make certain ideas less obscure — the construction of a universal program in Section. III of this paper is one such example.

Introduction. This paper is organized in a manner contrapositive to the talk. In the talk, we give a detailed overview of algorithmic complexity issueain codhg theory. Herein, westart with an overviewof the prominentrole that computational complexity plays in coding theory: we briefly surveythe numerousalgorithmic complexity issuesthat arise in code construction and decoding. Subsequently,we focus on one specific problem. Namely, we consider the problem of computing the minimum distance of a linear code, which is also equivalentto the problem of finding the shortest cycle in a linear matroid over a finite field (90). A long-standing conjecture (12) says that this problem is NP-hard, and we will settle this conjecture in the ai%rmative. We provide a detailed proof. We hope that our proof illustrates some of the elegant techniques used in coding theory today, such as the construction of MDS codes via Vandermonde matri- ces (15, 59, 72) and concatenated coding (23, 31), for instance. It is interesting that algebraic techniques of this kind cart be employed to answer an essentially combinatorial ques- tion.

We introduce the fundamental system architecture features that enable agnostic sensing missions on top of the ASTRO drones. We demonstrate the key principles of ASTRO by using on-board software-defined radios to find and track a mobile radio target. We show how simple distributed on-board machine learning methods can be used to find and track a mobile target, even if all drones lose contact with a ground control. Also, we show that ASTRO is able to find the target even if it is hiding under a three-ton concrete slab, representing a highly irregular propagation environment. Our findings reveal that, despite no prior training and noisy sensory measurements, ASTRO drones are able to learn the propagation environment in the scale of seconds and localize a target with a mean accuracy of 8 m. Moreover, ASTRO drones are able to track the target with relatively constant error over time, even as it moves at a speed close to the maximum drone speed.",Computer Science,3,0,present design implementation experimental evaluation astro modular endtoend system distributed sensing mission autonomous networked drone introduce fundamental system architecture feature enable agnostic sensing mission top astro drone demonstrate key principle astro using onboard softwaredefined radio find track mobile radio target show simple distributed onboard machine learning method used find track mobile target even drone lose contact ground control also show astro able find target even hiding threeton concrete slab representing highly irregular propagation environment finding reveal despite prior training noisy sensory measurement astro drone able learn propagation environment scale second localize target mean accuracy moreover astro drone able track target relatively constant error time even move speed close maximum drone speed

prove that verifying is easier than deciding for all theorems; provide a quite effective way to prove membership in computationally hard languages (such as ${\cal C}o$-$\cal N \cal P$-complete ones); and show that every computation possesses a short certificate vouching its correctness.

Alur and Dill have shown that the universality problem is undecidable if A has two clocks, but they left open the status of the problem when A has a single clock. In this paper we close this gap for timed automata over infinite words by showing that the one-clock universality problem is undecidable. For timed automata over finite words we show that the one-clock universality problem is decidable with non-primitive recursive complexity. This reveals a surprising divergence between the theory of timed automata over finite words and over infinite words. We also show that if e-transitions or non-singular postconditions are allowed, then the one-clock universality problem is undecidable over both finite and infinite words. Furthermore, we present a zone-based algorithm for solving the universality problem for single-clock timed automata. We apply the theory of better quasi-orderings, a refinement of the theory of well quasi-orderings, to prove termination of the algorithm. We have implemented a prototype tool based on our method, and checked universality for a number of timed automata. Comparisons with a region-based prototype tool confirm that zones are a more succinct representation, and hence allow a much more efficient implementation of the universality algorithm.",Computer Science,1,0,paper concerned universality problem timed automaton given timed automaton accept timed word alur dill shown universality problem undecidable two clock left open status problem single clock paper close gap timed automaton infinite word showing oneclock universality problem undecidable timed automaton finite word show oneclock universality problem decidable nonprimitive recursive complexity reveals surprising divergence theory timed automaton finite word infinite word also show etransitions nonsingular postconditions allowed oneclock universality problem undecidable finite infinite word furthermore present zonebased algorithm solving universality problem singleclock timed automaton apply theory better quasiorderings refinement theory well quasiorderings prove termination algorithm implemented prototype tool based method checked universality number timed automaton comparison regionbased prototype tool confirm zone succinct representation hence allow much efficient implementation universality algorithm

One promising technique for overcoming this problem is Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), which enables the compiler to optimistically create parallel threads despite uncertainty as to whether those threads are actually independent. In this paper we propose and evaluate a design for supporting TLS that seamlessly scales to any machine size because it is a straightforward extension of writeback invalidation-based cache coherence (which itself scales both up and down). Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs well on both single-chip multiprocessors and on larger-scale machines where communication latencies are twenty times larger.",Computer Science,1,0,architect understand build costeffective parallel machine across wide spectrum machine size ranging within single chip largescale server real challenge easily create parallel software effectively exploit raw performance potential one promising technique overcoming problem threadlevel speculation tl enables compiler optimistically create parallel thread despite uncertainty whether thread actually independent paper propose evaluate design supporting tl seamlessly scale machine size straightforward extension writeback invalidationbased cache coherence scale experimental result demonstrate scheme performs well singlechip multiprocessor largerscale machine communication latency twenty time larger

Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing.",Computer Science,1,0,introduce novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar formalism bilingual language modeling sentencepairs concept bilingual parsing variety parallel corpus analysis application aside bilingual orientation three major feature distinguish formalism finitestate transducer traditionally found computational linguistics skip directly contextfree rather finitestate base permit minimal extra degree ordering flexibility probabilistic formulation admits efficient maximumlikelihood bilingual parsing algorithm convenient normal form shown exist analysis formalism expressiveness suggests particularly well suited modeling ordering shift language balancing needed flexibility complexity constraint discus number example stochastic inversion transduction grammar bring bilingual constraint bear upon problematic corpus analysis task segmentation bracketing phrasal alignment parsing

A box-pushing task is described as a sequence of sub-tasks with a separate controller designed for each step using finite state automata theory. Perceptual cues are formed by concatenating binary variables which represent locally sensed stimuli into boolean vectors used to specify transitions between sub-task steps. The approach is designed for a redundant set of homogeneous mobile robots equipped with simple sensors and stimulus-response behaviours. A set of perceptual cues used in box-pushing are designed and tested on 10 physical mobile robots.

This notion generalizes the notion of (circular) colorings of graphs, the channel assignment problem, and several other optimization problems. For instance, its restriction to colorings of weighted complete graphs corresponds to the traveling salesman problem (metric case). It also gives rise to a new definition of the chromatic number of directed graphs.

It employs a bit-sliced crossbar fabric to switch packets at 10 Gbit/s at inputs and outputs, and adopts a novel token-tunneling technique to arbitrate contending packets at high speed (e.g,, within 10 ns), thus achieving a switch capacity of more than one terabit/sec by existing electronic technology.",Computer Science,3,0,inputoutput buffering moderate speedup widely considered feasible solution largecapacity switch propose new terabitsec packet switch call saturn switch terabit using dual roundrobin switch us simple dual roundrobin arbitration scheme schedule packet achieves high throughput low statistical delay bound employ bitsliced crossbar fabric switch packet gbit input output adopts novel tokentunneling technique arbitrate contending packet high speed eg within n thus achieving switch capacity one terabitsec existing electronic technology

The IR is graph-based and contains nodes fixed to control flow as well as floating nodes. Side-effecting nodes include a framestate that maps values back to the original program. Guard nodes dynamically check assumptions and, on failure, deoptimize to the interpreter that continues execution. Guards implicitly use the framestate and program position of the last side-effecting node. Therefore, they can be represented as freely floating nodes in the IR. Exception edges are modeled as explicit control flow and are subject to full optimization. We use profiling and deoptimization to speculatively reduce the number of such edges. The IR is the core of a just-in-time compiler that is integrated with the Java HotSpot VM.

The problems come from the fact that some programs written according to design patterns are too complicated and errorprone and that their overall structure is not easy to understand. This problem can be resolved by syntax extensions and extended language constructs that simplify description of the patterns and improve the readability of the programs. In our approach, programmers can use a MOP to write a library which implements syntax extensions and extended language constructs for supporting each design pattern.

Control information is sent over a dedicated signaling channel and data are sent over channels owned by the transmitters. Time is divided into slots on each channel and slots on the control channel are further split into mini-slots. Fixed time-division multiaccess (TDM) is used within each slot on the control channel. Transmitters indicate their intention to transmit a packet by transmitting the destination address during their appropriate mini-slot in the control channel and then transmit their packet in the next slot on their data channel. Receivers listen to the control channel and tune to the appropriate channel to receive packets addressed to them. A common but distributed arbitration algorithm is used to resolve conflicts when packets from many transmitters contend for the same receiver. Each receiver executes the same deterministic algorithm to choose one of the contending packets. Each transmitter uses the same algorithm to determine the success or failure of its packet. >,Computer Science,3,0,dynamic timewavelength division multiaccess protocol dtwdma proposed metropolitansized multichannel optical network employing fixed wavelength transmitter tunable optical receiver control information sent dedicated signaling channel data sent channel owned transmitter time divided slot channel slot control channel split minislots fixed timedivision multiaccess tdm used within slot control channel transmitter indicate intention transmit packet transmitting destination address appropriate minislot control channel transmit packet next slot data channel receiver listen control channel tune appropriate channel receive packet addressed common distributed arbitration algorithm used resolve conflict packet many transmitter contend receiver receiver executes deterministic algorithm choose one contending packet transmitter us algorithm determine success failure packet

The simplifications are dependent on viewing direction, lighting, and visibility and are performed by taking advantage of image-space, object-space, and frame-to-frame coherences. In contrast to the traditional approaches of precomputing a fixed number of level-of-detail representations for a given object, our approach involves statically generating a continuous level-of-detail representation for the object. This representation is then used at run time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications, where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer. Our approach is applicable for scalar (such as distance from the viewer) as well as vector (such as normal direction) attributes.",Computer Science,3,0,present algorithm performing adaptive realtime levelofdetailbased rendering triangulated polygonal model simplification dependent viewing direction lighting visibility performed taking advantage imagespace objectspace frametoframe coherence contrast traditional approach precomputing fixed number levelofdetail representation given object approach involves statically generating continuous levelofdetail representation object representation used run time guide selection appropriate triangle display list displayed triangle updated incrementally one frame next approach effective current levelofdetailbased rendering approach scientific visualization application limited number highly complex object stay relatively close viewer approach applicable scalar distance viewer well vector normal direction attribute

The language has been designed to be easy to learn and to use by people (for example, secretaries and mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor typesetting. Experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically. For example, the input sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i = pi over 2 produces ∑∞i=0xi = &pgr;/2 The syntax of the language is specified by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting commands.

It has been shown that these switches, with one-cell crosspoint buffer and round-robin (RR) arbitration at input and output ports, provide 100% throughput under uniform traffic.

But the account that relevance theory offers of how this gap is bridged, although originating as a development of Grice’s co-operative principle and conversational maxims, differs from other broadly Gricean accounts in certain fundamental respects, and leads to a stance on the nature of language, meaning and communication which is at odds, not only with the view of Grice himself, but also with the view common to most post-Fregean philosophy of language.",Computer Science,1,0,postgricean pragmatic theory relevance theory rt take starting point question hearer bridge gap sentence meaning speaker meaning gap given linguistic philosophy since grices logic conversation account relevance theory offer gap bridged although originating development grices cooperative principle conversational maxim differs broadly gricean account certain fundamental respect lead stance nature language meaning communication odds view grice also view common postfregean philosophy language

It also makes it possible to produce small stand-alone executable files as the result of the compilation process.

We first present a domain-specific language, called Cobalt, for implementing optimizations as guarded rewrite rules. Cobalt optimizations operate over a C-like intermediate representation including unstructured control flow, pointers to local variables and dynamically allocated memory, and recursive procedures. Then we describe a technique for automatically proving the soundness of Cobalt optimizations. Our technique requires an automatic theorem prover to discharge a small set of simple, optimization-specific proof obligations for each optimization. We have written a variety of forward and backward intraprocedural dataflow optimizations in Cobalt, including constant propagation and folding, branch folding, full and partial redundancy elimination, full and partial dead assignment elimination, and simple forms of points-to analysis. We implemented our soundness-checking strategy using the Simplify automatic theorem prover, and we have used this implementation to automatically prove our optimizations correct. Our checker found many subtle bugs during the course of developing our optimizations. We also implemented an execution engine for Cobalt optimizations as part of the Whirlwind compiler infrastructure.",Computer Science,2,0,describe technique automatically proving compiler optimization sound meaning transformation always semanticspreserving first present domainspecific language called cobalt implementing optimization guarded rewrite rule cobalt optimization operate clike intermediate representation including unstructured control flow pointer local variable dynamically allocated memory recursive procedure describe technique automatically proving soundness cobalt optimization technique requires automatic theorem prover discharge small set simple optimizationspecific proof obligation optimization written variety forward backward intraprocedural dataflow optimization cobalt including constant propagation folding branch folding full partial redundancy elimination full partial dead assignment elimination simple form pointsto analysis implemented soundnesschecking strategy using simplify automatic theorem prover used implementation automatically prove optimization correct checker found many subtle bug course developing optimization also implemented execution engine cobalt optimization part whirlwind compiler infrastructure

However, neither IA nor IOMTS consider conjunction that is needed in practice when a component satisfies multiple interfaces, while Larsen's MTS-conjunction is not closed. In addition, IOMTS-parallel composition exhibits a compositionality defect. 
 
This paper defines conjunction on IA and MTS and proves the operators to be 'correct', i.e., the greatest lower bounds wrt. IA- and resp. MTS-refinement. As its main contribution, a novel interface theory called Modal Interface Automata (MIA) is introduced: MIA is a rich subset of IOMTS, is equipped with compositional parallel and conjunction operators, and allows a simpler embedding of IA than Nyman's.

477,354faa8b2e5e0813277ad8e5e663d61ed1f4db31,On numbers and games,"Some readers know to play the game of nim well, fewer play a perfect annihilation game, and nobody knows whether there exists an opening move in chess that will guarantee a win for white. These games and many more, belong to the family of combinatorial games, by which we mean the set of all two-player perfect-information games without chance moves and with outcomes lose or win (and sometimes: dynamic tie). The motivation for ONAG may have been, and perhaps was-and I would like to think that it was-the attempt to bridge the theory gap between nim-like and chess-like games. Why is there a gap? Every combinatorial game can be described as a directed graph called game-graph, whose vertices are the game positions, and (u, v) is a directed edge if and only if there is a move from position u to position v. Denote by N the set of all positions from which the Next (first) player can force a win; by P the set of all positions from which the Previous (second) player can force a win; and by T the set of all (dynamic) Tie positions, which are positions from which no player can force a win and therefore both can avoid losing. In an acyclic game-graph there cannot be any tie positions. The N, P, T classification of any game graph R = (V, E) can be determined in 0(\V\ + \E\) steps [8]. For both nim and chess, a finite game-graph can be constructed and the N, P, T classification can be determined. So both games are solvable in principle. If we play nim with n piles, each pile containing at most k tokens, then the game-graph contains (k + \) vertices. Suppose that in (generalized) chess played on an « X « board there are k different pieces. If k is about n/2, then the game-graph of chess contains O (2"") vertices. So both game-graphs have exponentially many vertices, and thus both games appear intractable in the usual sense of computational complexity [1, Chapter 10], [14, Chapter 9], namely a computation appears to be required which is asymptotically exponential. From a computational efficiency standpoint, the essential difference between nim and chess is that nim can be viewed as a disjunctive compound (sum) of independent games, namely the individual piles.

The first supplies algorithms with a high degree of freedom, without increasing the number of physical channels. The second methodology is intended for the design of fault-tolerant algorithms. Some examples are given to show the application of the methodologies. Simulations show the performance improvement that can be achieved by designing the routing algorithms with the new theory. >",Computer Science,3,0,theoretical background design deadlockfree adaptive routing algorithm wormhole network developed author proposes basic definition two theorem create condition verify adaptive algorithm deadlockfree even cycle channel dependency graph two design methodology also proposed first supply algorithm high degree freedom without increasing number physical channel second methodology intended design faulttolerant algorithm example given show application methodology simulation show performance improvement achieved designing routing algorithm new theory

503,337bb008eb531c4e8152d6c99423e715ce0d9b05,PEGASUS: A Peta-Scale Graph Mining System Implementation and Observations,"In this paper, we describe PEGASUS, an open source Peta Graph Mining library which performs typical graph mining tasks such as computing the diameter of the graph, computing the radius of each node and finding the connected components. As the size of graphs reaches several Giga-, Tera- or Peta-bytes, the necessity for such a library grows too. To the best of our knowledge, PEGASUS is the first such library, implemented on the top of the Hadoop platform, the open source version of MapReduce. Many graph mining operations (PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connected components etc.) are essentially a repeated matrix-vector multiplication.

In our design, programs are represented using a standard low-level intermediate form based on controlow graphs. The compiler is structured as a set of components. Each component performs a speci c transformation and produces a proof that the transformation is correct. Typically, the correctness proof will consist of two subproofs: a subproof that the analysis of the input program produced a correct result, and a subproof that establishes a simulation relation between the original and transformed programs. The paper presents two logics, one for each kind of subproof, and shows that the logics are sound. A novel and important feature of our framework is its simultaneous support for both formal reasoning and sophisticated compiler transformations that deal with the program and the target machine at a very low level.

In this paper, we present a distributed sequential auction scheme that takes the UAV limitations into account and provides a systematic procedure for the auction process. The task allocation scheme first validates the targets using neighbor's knowledge and then, depending on the decisions obtained from neighbors, an agent decides to auction or forfeit the target. The targets detected within a sensor range are validated and auctioned sequentially. A simulation study was conducted for different sensor and communication ranges to evaluate the performance of the sequential auction scheme which was compared with a greedy strategy and a simple distributed auction scheme.

These situations are modeled by assuming that an agent who does not acquire the object for sale incurs an identity-dependent externality. The authors construct a revenue-maximizing auction for the seller. They observe that outside options and participation constraints are endogenous; the seller extracts surplus also from agents who do not obtain the auctioned object; and the seller is better-off by not selling at all (while obtaining some payments) if externalities are much larger than valuations.

These assumptions allow the authors to estimate the effects of several variables on arbitrators' decisions in 1984–91 cases. They find statistically significant effects for four variables that the industry's collective bargaining agreement identifies as matters arbitrators should consider—the player's performance during the previous season, the length and consistency of the player's career performance, previous compensation, and the club's recent performance—and for one variable not mentioned in that agreement—player position.",Economics,3,0,two assumption analysis baseball salary arbitration player club serve interest prearbitration negotiation submit final offer maximize minimize respectively expected value arbitrator decision arbitrator whose decision predictably biased appointed settle player dispute arbitrator vetoed one side assumption allow author estimate effect several variable arbitrator decision case find statistically significant effect four variable industry collective bargaining agreement identifies matter arbitrator considerthe player performance previous season length consistency player career performance previous compensation club recent performanceand one variable mentioned agreementplayer position

607,59e2338ac61ce90fa6acae14390243a4edd1ec95,"The Electronic Mail Game: Strategic Behavior Under ""Almost Common Knowledge""","This paper addresses a paradoxical game theoretic example which is closely related to the coordinated attack problem. Two players have to play one of two possible coordination games. Only one of them receives information about the coordination game to be played.

Concepts of joint failure importance (JFI) and marginal failure importance (MFI), duals of JRI and marginal reliability importance (MRI), are also introduced. The JRI of two edges in an undirected network is represented by the MRI of each edge in subnetworks. Relationships between JRI and MRI, JRI and JFI, and JFI and MFI are presented. From these relationships, it is shown that the JRI is an appropriate quantitative measure of the interactions of two edges in a network, with respect to source-to-terminal reliability. It can also show that the sign of the JRI of two edges can be determined without computing the JRI of these two edges in some special cases. >",Mathematics,0,0,joint reliability importance jri two edge undirected network introduced concept joint failure importance jfi marginal failure importance mfi duals jri marginal reliability importance mri also introduced jri two edge undirected network represented mri edge subnetworks relationship jri mri jri jfi jfi mfi presented relationship shown jri appropriate quantitative measure interaction two edge network respect sourcetoterminal reliability also show sign jri two edge determined without computing jri two edge special case

If a series of measurements, physical, biological, anthropological, or economical, not of the same object, but of a group of objects of the same type or family, be made, and a curve be constructed by plotting up the number of times the measurements fall within a given small unit of range to the range, this curve may be termed a frequency curve. As a rule this frequency curve takes the well known form of the curve of errors, and such a curve may be termed a normal frequency curve. The latter curve is symmetrical about its maximum ordinate. Occasionally, however, frequency curves do not take the normal form, and are then generally, but not necessarily, asymmetrical.",Mathematics,2,0,series measurement physical biological anthropological economical object group object type family made curve constructed plotting number time measurement fall within given small unit range range curve may termed frequency curve rule frequency curve take well known form curve error curve may termed normal frequency curve latter curve symmetrical maximum ordinate occasionally however frequency curve take normal form generally necessarily asymmetrical

Some of the gaps in the relevant graph theory are as follows.

It was conjectured that the laws of this commutative algebra would form a suitable starting point for a generalization of the present quantum mechanical theory. The need of such a generalization arises from the (probably) fundamental difficulties resulting when one attempts to apply quantum mechanics to questions in relativistic and nuclear phenomena.,Mathematics,3,0,one u shown statistical property measurement quantum mechanical system assume simplest form expressed term certain hypercomplex algebra commutative associative algebra differs noncommutative associative matrix algebra usually considered one concerned commutative expression b b instead associative product b two matrix conjectured law commutative algebra would form suitable starting point generalization present quantum mechanical theory need generalization arises probably fundamental difficulty resulting one attempt apply quantum mechanic question relativistic nuclear phenomenon

Definition 1. A problem is a problem I cannot solve, not necessarily an unsolved problem. 1. Sums and differences For any set A of integers, we define the sumset A + A = {a + a : a, a ∈ A} and the difference set A − A = {a− a : a, a ∈ A}. In this section we consider finite sets of integers, and the relative sizes of their sumsets and difference sets. If A is a finite set of integers and x, y ∈ Z, then the translation of A by x is the set x + A = {x + a : a ∈ A} and the dilation of A by y is y ∗ A = {ya : a ∈ A}. We have (x + A) + (x + A) = 2x + 2A and (x + A) − (x + A) = A − A. Similarly, y ∗ A + y ∗ A = y ∗ (A + A) and y ∗ A − y ∗ A = y ∗ (A − A). It follows that |(x + y ∗ A) + (x + y ∗ A)| = |2A| and |(x + y ∗ A) − (x + y ∗ A)| = |A − A| so the cardinalities of the sum and difference sets of a finite set of integers are invariant under affine transformations of the set. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11B05, 11B13, 11B34.",Mathematics,0,0,talk atelier en combinatoire additive workshop arithmetic combinatorics centre de recherches mathématiques université de montréal april definition problem problem solve necessarily unsolved problem sum difference set integer define sumset difference set section consider finite set integer relative size sumsets difference set finite set integer x z translation x set x x dilation ya x x x x x similarly follows x x x x cardinality sum difference set finite set integer invariant affine transformation set mathematics subject classification b b b

The third one is based on the concept of attractors and it refines the classification introduced by Hurley [16]. We show relations between these classifications and give examples of cellular automata in the intersection classes. In particular, we show that every positively expansive cellular automaton is conjugate to a one-sided subshift of finite type and that every topologically transitive cellular automaton is sensitive to initial conditions. We also construct a cellular automaton with minimal quasi-attractor, whose basin has measure zero, answering a question raised in Hurley [16].",Mathematics,3,0,consider three related classification cellular automaton first based complexity language generated clopen partition state space ie complexity factor subshifts second based concept equicontinuity modification classification introduced gilman third one based concept attractor refines classification introduced hurley show relation classification give example cellular automaton intersection class particular show every positively expansive cellular automaton conjugate onesided subshift finite type every topologically transitive cellular automaton sensitive initial condition also construct cellular automaton minimal quasiattractor whose basin measure zero answering question raised hurley

Let 0 < a, < a,. .. be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Denote by f(n) the number of solutions of n=a i +a;. About twenty years ago, SIDON 1) raised the question wether there exists a sequence a; satisfying f(n) > 0 for all n > 1 and lim f(n)'nE = 0 for all t > 0. In the present note, I will construct such a sequence. In fact, my sequence will satisfy (1) 0 < f(n) < c l log n for all n > l. (The c's will denote suitable positive absolute constants .) It seems probable that (1) can not be strengthened very much. TURAN and I conjectured 2) that if f(n) > 0 for all n > n0 then lim sup f(n)=-; this conjecture seems very hard to prove. A still stronger conjecture would be the following : Let a,< a.,<. .. be an infinite sequence of integers satisfying 0). < ck2. Then lim sup f(n) _ c,~. We will not be able to construct our sequences explicitely, but we will be able to show that in some sense almost all sequences satisfy (1). The idea of our construction is the following. Define A k as the least integer greater than c2 k""i 2'2', 2. Pick in all possible ways A,, integers from the interval , (2k 2'~+') One can do this in (A~) ways. One thus obtains the integers J < b2kl <. .. < b.4.

Thus roughly speaking (1) will be satisfied for almost all choices of the b(k'. We have to make one more remark. For small values of k it may happen that c2 2 k,12 k' 2 > 2k. In this case the b(k) are simply all the integers of the interval (2 k, 2k} 1).

It turns out that such curves can be counted by means of certain lattice paths in the Newton polygon. The formula was announced earlier in [17].

We give an error analysis of the evaluation of the interpolating polynomial using these two forms. The modified Lagrange formula is shown to be backward stable. The barycentric formula has a less favourable error analysis, but is forward stable for any set of interpolating points with a small Lebesgue constant. Therefore the barycentric formula can be significantly less accurate than the modified Lagrange formula only for a poor choice of interpolating points. This analysis provides further weight to the argument of Berrut and Trefethen that barycentric Lagrange interpolation should be the polynomial interpolation method of choice.",Mathematics,3,0,lagrange representation interpolating polynomial rewritten two computationally attractive form modified lagrange form barycentric form give error analysis evaluation interpolating polynomial using two form modified lagrange formula shown backward stable barycentric formula le favourable error analysis forward stable set interpolating point small lebesgue constant therefore barycentric formula significantly le accurate modified lagrange formula poor choice interpolating point analysis provides weight argument berrut trefethen barycentric lagrange interpolation polynomial interpolation method choice

This is true of mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumed practical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorial auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of these mechanisms - in particular, their truth revelation properties - assumes that the optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimization problems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigate the impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones. Specifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method, which has empirically been shown to perform well. We show that the GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. We introduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restricted class of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying sufficient conditions for a combinatorial auction to be truth-revealing, conditions which have applicability beyond the specific auction studied here.",Mathematics,2,0,important classical mechanism considered microeconomics game theory require solution difficult optimization problem true mechanism combinatorial auction recent year assumed practical importance particular gold standard combinatorial auction generalized vickrey auction gva traditional analysis mechanism particular truth revelation property assumes optimization problem solved precisely reality optimization problem usually solved approximate fashion investigate impact mechanism replacing exact solution approximate one specifically look particular greedy optimization method empirically shown perform well show gva payment scheme provide truth revealing mechanism introduce another scheme guarantee truthfulness restricted class player demonstrate latter property identifying sufficient condition combinatorial auction truthrevealing condition applicability beyond specific auction studied

In this paper an analogous difference operator is studied for an arbitrary graph. It is shown that many properties of the Laplacian in the continuous setting (e.g. the maximum principle, the Harnack inequality, and Cheeger's bound for the lowest eigenvalue) hold for this difference oper- ator. The difference Laplacian governs the random walk on a graph, just as the Laplace operator governs the Brownian motion. As an application of the theory of the difference Laplacian, it is shown that the random walk on a class of graphs is transient. The random walks we consider are defined as follows. Let K be a connected graph (i.e. a one dimensional simplicial complex). For a vertex x E K, let m(x) denote the number of edges emanating from x. The probability that a particle moves from x to another vertex y E K is l/m(x) if x and y are connected by an edge and it is zero otherwise. As observed by Courant, Friedrichs and Lewy (CFL) for the case of a square lattice in the plane this random walk is intimately related to the difference analog of the Laplacian",Mathematics,3,0,difference laplacian square lattice rn stud ied many author paper analogous difference operator studied arbitrary graph shown many property laplacian continuous setting eg maximum principle harnack inequality cheegers bound lowest eigenvalue hold difference oper ator difference laplacian governs random walk graph laplace operator governs brownian motion application theory difference laplacian shown random walk class graph transient random walk consider defined follows let k connected graph ie one dimensional simplicial complex vertex x e k let mx denote number edge emanating x probability particle move x another vertex e k lmx x connected edge zero otherwise observed courant friedrichs lewy cfl case square lattice plane random walk intimately related difference analog laplacian

However, in deference to some recent attempts to unify the terminology of graph theory we replace the term 'circuit' by 'polygon', and 'degree' by 'valency'. A graph G is 3-connected (nodally 3-connected) if it is simple and non-separable and satisfies the following condition; if G is the union of two proper subgraphs H and K such that HnK consists solely of two vertices u and v, then one of H and K is a link-graph (arc-graph) with ends u and v. It should be noted that the union of two proper subgraphs H and K of G can be the whole of G only if each of H and K includes at least one edge or vertex not belonging to the other. In this paper we are concerned mainly with nodally 3-connected graphs, but a specialization to 3-connected graphs is made in § 12. In § 3 we discuss conditions for a nodally 3-connected graph to be planar, and in § 5 we discuss conditions for the existence of Kuratowski subgraphs of a given graph. In §§ 6-9 we show how to obtain a convex representation of a nodally 3-connected graph, without Kuratowski subgraphs, by solving a set of linear equations. Some extensions of these results to general graphs, with a proof of Kuratowski's theorem, are given in §§ 10-11. In § 12 we discuss the representation in the plane of a pair of dual graphs, and in § 13 we draw attention to some unsolved problems.",Mathematics,2,0,w e use definition however deference recent attempt unify terminology graph theory replace term circuit polygon degree valency graph g connected nodally connected simple nonseparable satisfies following condition g union two proper subgraphs h k hnk consists solely two vertex u v one h k linkgraph arcgraph end u v noted union two proper subgraphs h k g whole g h k includes least one edge vertex belonging paper concerned mainly nodally connected graph specialization connected graph made discus condition nodally connected graph planar discus condition existence kuratowski subgraphs given graph show obtain convex representation nodally connected graph without kuratowski subgraphs solving set linear equation extension result general graph proof kuratowskis theorem given discus representation plane pair dual graph draw attention unsolved problem

In particular, it shows that a rank-dependent preference functional is obtained in this set-up when the independence axiom is weakened to stochastic dominance and a probability trade-off consistency condition. In contrast with the existing axiomatizations of rank-dependent utility, the resulting axioms allow for complete flexibility regarding the outcome space. Consequently, a parameter-free test/elicitation of rank-dependent utility becomes possible. The probability-oriented approach of this paper also provides theoretical foundations for probabilistic attitudes towards risk. It is shown that the preference conditions that characterize the shape of the probability weighting function can be derived from simple probability trade-off conditions.

No such number is known and indeed it seems unlikely that any such number exists. In this paper, we prove a new transcendence theorem which answers the Hartmanis-Stearns question in the negative for a restricted class of machines. More precisely, we show that the decimal expansion of an algebraic irrational cannot be generated by a finite automaton. In this sense, such expansions are relatively complicated, but we are still a long way from proving that they are random, or even normal. This connection between the Hartmanis-Stearns problem and transcendence theory was noted by Cobham [5] and our argument follows the spirit of his remarks.",Mathematics,1,0,hartmanis stearns posed problem finding algebraic irrational whose decimal expansion realtime computable number known indeed seems unlikely number exists paper prove new transcendence theorem answer hartmanisstearns question negative restricted class machine precisely show decimal expansion algebraic irrational generated finite automaton sense expansion relatively complicated still long way proving random even normal connection hartmanisstearns problem transcendence theory noted cobham argument follows spirit remark

IntroductionIt is well known that Levi–Malcev theorem is valid for Lie algebras and Malcevalgebras. But it is not valid for binary-Lie algebras (in classical sense) as wellas for Bol algebras. Since the Levi–Malcev theorem plays the basic role instructural theories, it is useful to get some generalized version of such a theoremfor Bol algebras. In this report the problem for so-called homogeneous Bolalgebras with some examples will be discussed.Let us note that the problem is important in applications to Diﬀerentialgeometry and Smooth Quasigroups and Loops theory (because that Bol algebrais the proper inﬁnitesimal object for a smooth Bol loop, and any symmetricspace, for example, is a smooth Bol loop).It is also noted that, Bol loops and Bol algebras are signiﬁcant in Mathe-matical Physics (chiral anomalies etc.).Remark: The smooth Bol loops-Bol algebras theory is due to L.V. Sabinin,P.O. Mikheev. See, for example [2].2.

The algorithmic construction of the linearizing output proceeds inductively, and each stage has two structures, namely a codimension one foliation defined through an integrable 1-form ω , and a transversal vectorfield g to the foliation. Each integral manifold of the vectorfield g defines an equivalence class of points. Due to transversality, a leaf of the foliation is chosen to represent these equivalence classes. A Lie groupoid is defined with its base given as the particular chosen leaf and with the product induced by the pseudogroup of diffeomorphisms that preserve equivalence classes generated by the integral manifolds of g.

The particle interpretation is no longer applicable, but the transfer expressions can still be conveniently summarized in terms of ‘transfer’ diagrams, which correspond to collision diagrams in the particle picture. The method is applied to interactions between gravity waves and the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. The complete set of lowest order transfer diagrams contains the Phillips and Miles mechanisms of wave generation and an additional set of wave-turbulence interactions, which have not been considered previously. The closure hypothesis invoked in the derivation of the transfer expressions is discussed briefly in appendix A. It is pointed out that Benney & Saffman’s recent derivation of the transfer expressions without the usual closure hypothesis contradicts the irreversibility of the transfer expressions and is valid only initially. The relevant statistical properties depend on the distinction between coarse grained and fine grained distributions. This is illustrated in appendix B by a discussion of the Gaussian property of linear, random wave fields.",Mathematics,3,0,feynman diagram method analysing wavewave interaction random wave field generalized include nonconservative interaction wave field external field particle interpretation longer applicable transfer expression still conveniently summarized term transfer diagram correspond collision diagram particle picture method applied interaction gravity wave turbulent atmospheric boundary layer complete set lowest order transfer diagram contains phillips mile mechanism wave generation additional set waveturbulence interaction considered previously closure hypothesis invoked derivation transfer expression discussed briefly appendix pointed benney saffmans recent derivation transfer expression without usual closure hypothesis contradicts irreversibility transfer expression valid initially relevant statistical property depend distinction coarse grained fine grained distribution illustrated appendix b discussion gaussian property linear random wave field

The algorithmic construction of the linearizing output proceeds inductively, and each stage has two structures, namely a codimension one foliation defined through an integrable 1-form $\omega$ , and a transversal vectorfield $g$ to the foliation. Each integral manifold of the vectorfield $g$ defines an equivalence class of points. Due to transversality, a leaf of the foliation is chosen to represent these equivalence classes. A Lie groupoid is defined with its base given as the particular chosen leaf and with the product induced by the pseudogroup of diffeomorphisms that preserve equivalence classes generated by the integral manifolds of g. Two Lie algebroids associated with this groupoid are then defined. The theory is illustrated with an example using polynomial automorphisms as particular cases of diffeomorphisms and shows the relation with the Jacobian conjecture.",Mathematics,2,0,two lie algebroids presented linked construction linearizing output affine input nonlinear system algorithmic construction linearizing output proceeds inductively stage two structure namely codimension one foliation defined integrable form omega transversal vectorfield g foliation integral manifold vectorfield g defines equivalence class point due transversality leaf foliation chosen represent equivalence class lie groupoid defined base given particular chosen leaf product induced pseudogroup diffeomorphisms preserve equivalence class generated integral manifold g two lie algebroids associated groupoid defined theory illustrated example using polynomial automorphisms particular case diffeomorphisms show relation jacobian conjecture

The goal at that time was to bring together the perspectives of theoretical computer scientists and of working algebraic geometers, while laying out what we considered to be the main computational problems and bounds on their complexity. Only part of the talkwas written down and since that time there has been a good deal of progress. However, the material that was written up may still serve as a useful introduction to some of the ideas and estimates used in this field (at least the editors of this volume thinkso), even though most of the results included here are either published elsewhere, or exist as “folk-theorems” by now.

This theory is based on an analysis of the interrelationships of the various coalitions which can be formed by the players of the game. Our theory, in contradistinction, is based on the absence of coalitions in that it is assumed that each participant acts independently, without collaboration or communication with any of the others. The notion of an equilibrium point is the basic ingredient in our theory. This notion yields a generalization of the concept of the solution of a two-person zerosum game. It turns out that the set of equilibrium points of a two-person zerosum game is simply the set of all pairs of opposing ""good strategies."" In the immediately following sections we shall define equilibrium points and prove that a finite non-cooperative game always has at least one equilibrium point. We shall also introduce the notions of solvability and strong solvability of a non-cooperative game and prove a theorem on the geometrical structure of the set of equilibrium points of a solvable game.

To investigate the prevalence of microscopic subchondral bone injury in the distal metacarpi/tarsi of Thoroughbred racehorses and associations with recent and cumulative training history.


METHODS
Metacarpi/metatarsi were obtained from postmortem examination of Thoroughbred racehorses. The severity of palmar/plantar osteochondral disease (POD) was graded in forelimbs from 38 horses and in hindlimbs from a separate cohort of 45 horses. Forelimb samples were embedded in methyl methacrylate and examined using backscattered scanning electron microscopy. Microfracture density in the condylar subchondral bone was determined. Horizontal subchondral bone fractures were identified in hindlimb samples using sections of demineralised tissue. Empty osteocyte lacunae were quantified in hindlimb samples using sections of demineralised tissue.


RESULTS
The prevalence of gross POD was 65.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48.7-80.4%) in the forelimb and 57.8% (95% CI 42.2-72.3%) in the hindlimb cohort of horses. Microfractures occurred in the forelimbs of 97.4% (95% CI 86.2-99.9%) of horses. Microfracture density in forelimbs increased with age (rs  = 0.50, P = 0.001), the number of race starts (rs  = 0.47, P = 0.003) and was greater in the medial condyles of horses in training than in those not in training (n = 21, median: 3.1/mm; range: 0.8-10.0 vs n = 17, 1.4/mm; 0-4.5, P = 0.008). Empty osteocyte lacunae were observed in the subchondral bone of hindlimbs in 97.7% (95% CI 88.0-99.9%) of 44 horses.

Aesthetic considerations imply the creation of a glanslike structured tip. A review of the scarce literature on sculpturing of a glans is given. In cases in which microsurgical free-flap techniques are applied in our hospital, the glans is usually sculptured to its final appearance during the actual phalloplasty. If, on the other hand, an abdominal or inguinal skin flap is used, final sculpturing will be done as a subsequent separate procedure. From a review of the literature on this subject and from our experience, one may conclude that the Norfolk technique of coronal ridge and sulcus construction has best results.

On oral examination, left caudal crossbite was diagnosed. Dental radiographs revealed endodontic disease of the mandibular first molar tooth involved in the crossbite. Because of the difficulty of treating caudal crossbite and the potential of a pathological mandibular fracture, the endodontically affected tooth was extracted. Ten months following the extraction, mandibular deviation and alveolar bone lysis were resolved, but alveolar ridge resorption was present.

Thus, drugs that selectively target cancer stem cells offer great promise for cancer treatment, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Here, we show that low doses of metformin, a standard drug for diabetes, inhibits cellular transformation and selectively kills cancer stem cells in four genetically different types of breast cancer. The combination of metformin and a well-defined chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, kills both cancer stem cells and non-stem cancer cells in culture. Furthermore, this combinatorial therapy reduces tumor mass and prevents relapse much more effectively than either drug alone in a xenograft mouse model. Mice seem to remain tumor-free for at least 2 months after combinatorial therapy with metformin and doxorubicin is ended.

In PDT, a photosensitizer (PS) is administered that can be activated by light of a specific wavelength, which causes selective damage to the tumor and its surrounding vasculature. The success of PDT is limited by the difficulty in administering photosensitizers (PSs) with low water solubility, which compromises the clinical use of several molecules. Incorporation of PSs in nanostructured drug delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), hydrogels, liposomes, liquid crystals, dendrimers, and cyclodextrin is a potential strategy to overcome this difficulty. Additionally, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems may improve the transcytosis of a PS across epithelial and endothelial barriers and afford the simultaneous co-delivery of two or more drugs. Based on this, the application of nanotechnology in medicine may offer numerous exciting possibilities in cancer treatment and improve the efficacy of available therapeutics.

However, despite the strength of the association, it only accounted for 2% of the variance, indicating that contributions from other genes were probable. In the present study, we investigated the original cohort of subjects to evaluate the gene for the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor alpha-1 subunit (GABRA1). The possible association of GABRA1 with the psychopathology of major psychoses was tested both alone and in interaction with DRD4. Four hundred and sixty-one inpatients affected by major psychoses were assessed by the operational criteria checklist for psychotic illness (OPCRIT) and were also typed for the DRD4 and GABRA1 variants using PCR techniques. Mania, depression, delusion, and disorganization were the four symptomatologic factors used as phenotype definitions. GABRA1 variants were not associated with these symptomatologic factors, and consideration of possible stratification effects such as sex and psychiatric diagnosis also did not reveal any association.

Knowledge about it began, in antiquity, through artists, particularly Greek and Roman, and then Japanese in the 18th century with their representation of cauliflower deformation of the ear on sculptures and paintings of pugilists and wrestlers. It is only in the 19th century that physicians began to make substantive progress in understanding this abnormality. It was first thought to be associated with mental disease, but by the beginning of the 20th century, its etiology was recognized as being caused by trauma and was then named auricular hematoma. The second step in the understanding of this affliction was the observation that auricular hematoma progresses toward cauliflower deformation of the ear, which was named cauliflower ear. Recognition of this evolution led to the development of therapies. During the second half of the 20th century, different treatments were developed. They included various hematoma drainage techniques with special bandages to prevent hematoma recurrence and ensuing progression to cauliflower ear. In summary, cauliflower deformation of the ear is an old artistic affliction that has only recently received medical attention.",Medicine,2,0,abstract auricular hematoma cauliflower deformation ear unique several respect knowledge began antiquity artist particularly greek roman japanese th century representation cauliflower deformation ear sculpture painting pugilist wrestler th century physician began make substantive progress understanding abnormality first thought associated mental disease beginning th century etiology recognized caused trauma named auricular hematoma second step understanding affliction observation auricular hematoma progress toward cauliflower deformation ear named cauliflower ear recognition evolution led development therapy second half th century different treatment developed included various hematoma drainage technique special bandage prevent hematoma recurrence ensuing progression cauliflower ear summary cauliflower deformation ear old artistic affliction recently received medical attention

At the onset of clinical signs, radiographic lesions were not present (4 horses) or subtle (5 horses), but were easily identified on radiographs taken 4 to 24 weeks later. Arthroscopic surgery was delayed until radiographic changes became obvious. Surgical findings in 20 femoropatellar joints were most commonly osteochondral ""flaps"" located on the proximal lateral trochlear ridge of the femur and were larger than had been indicated by the radiographs. Eight horses were being used for their intended purpose, which was racing (3 horses were racing and 3 were in race training), dressage (1 horse) or pleasure riding (1 horse). One horse required a second surgery when similar lesions developed on the opposite stifle, and was euthanatized 2 months later because of persistent lameness. One clinical signs are observed, osteochondrosis lesions of the distal femur can progress in foals younger than 9 months of age and the full extent of the radiographic lesion may take several weeks to develop.",Medicine,2,0,clinical radiographic progression arthroscopic finding nine young horse year age femoropatellar osteochondrosis ocd presented horse week history bilateral horse unilateral horse hindlimb lameness consistent clinical sign included femoropatellar joint distention bilateral hindlimb lameness onset clinical sign radiographic lesion present horse subtle horse easily identified radiograph taken week later arthroscopic surgery delayed radiographic change became obvious surgical finding femoropatellar joint commonly osteochondral flap located proximal lateral trochlear ridge femur larger indicated radiograph eight horse used intended purpose racing horse racing race training dressage horse pleasure riding horse one horse required second surgery similar lesion developed opposite stifle euthanatized month later persistent lameness one clinical sign observed osteochondrosis lesion distal femur progress foal younger month age full extent radiographic lesion may take several week develop

This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of how neutrophils are produced, how these cells leave the circulation, the molecular events regulating neutrophil activation and, ultimately, how these cells die and are removed. The neutrophil is now recognized as a highly versatile and sophisticated cell with significant synthetic capacity and an important role in linking the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. One of the key challenges in conditions such as COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and certain forms of asthma is how to manipulate neutrophil function in a way that does not compromise antibacterial and antifungal capacity.

The source of the difficulty can be traced back to the efforts of the early Fathers to reconcile the essentially pagan concept of an immaterial and immortal soul with apostolic teachings about the after-life in which all the emphasis is placed upon the resurrection of the body. The tensions between these two traditions inevitably became strained during the sixteenth century when Protestant reformers insisted on a closer adherence to Scripture. Furthermore, even when leaving the problems of Scriptural hermeneutics aside, the dualistic approach to the question, in which soul (or spirit) and body are held to be categorically different in essence, had to overcome a number of intractable philosophical problems. So, it was not simply coincidence that when the new mechanical philosophy began to be formulated in a systematic way in the seventeenth century, it was couched in vigorously dualistic terms. In fact, three of the earliest fully elaborated systems of mechanical philosophy, those of Descartes, Digby, and Charleton, were explicitly intended to provide a philosophical prop for dualist theology.' Moreover, it was because of its usefulness in promoting dualism that Cartesianism was first popularized in England not by a natural philosopher but by the Cambridge Platonist and theologian, Henry More.2",Medicine,2,0,nature soul relationship body always proved problematical christian philosophy source difficulty traced back effort early father reconcile essentially pagan concept immaterial immortal soul apostolic teaching afterlife emphasis placed upon resurrection body tension two tradition inevitably became strained sixteenth century protestant reformer insisted closer adherence scripture furthermore even leaving problem scriptural hermeneutics aside dualistic approach question soul spirit body held categorically different essence overcome number intractable philosophical problem simply coincidence new mechanical philosophy began formulated systematic way seventeenth century couched vigorously dualistic term fact three earliest fully elaborated system mechanical philosophy descartes digby charleton explicitly intended provide philosophical prop dualist theology moreover usefulness promoting dualism cartesianism first popularized england natural philosopher cambridge platonist theologian henry

Two different species of Hepatozoon infect dogs - Hepatozoon canis in the Old World and South America, and Hepatozoon americanum in the southern USA. H canis infection varies from being asymptomatic in dogs with a low parasitaemia, to causing severe disease with anaemia, profound lethargy and cachexia in dogs with large numbers of circulating parasites. H americanum infection manifests mainly as gait abnormalities and musculoskeletal pain due to myositis and periosteal bone lesions. Feline hepatozoonosis is associated with muscular pathology and is often reported in conjunction with a retroviral disease. The diagnosis of hepatozoonosis relies mainly on the detection of blood gamonts in the case of H canis infection, and on muscle biopsy showing tissue cysts and pyogranulomas for H americanum infection. Therapy for both forms of the disease involves long-term treatment with combinations of antiprotozoal drugs.

This paper reports the incidence of radiographic lesions of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the femoropatellar joint relative to the development of clinical symptoms in the 1989 foal crop, and the clinical symptoms, radiographic features and outcome of the 1990 and 1991 foal crops affected with OCD at the same Thoroughbred farm. In the 1989 foal crop, 23 of 96 yearlings were identified with clinical and/or radiographic signs of OCD. They had an average age of 12.6 months at identification. Eighteen cases had clinical and radiographic signs of osteochondrosis, 3 had clinical signs in the stifles without radiographic signs and 2 had radiographic signs of osteochondrosis but no clinical signs (one eventually became symptomatic). Of the cases with clinical signs but no radiographic signs, one subsequently developed radiographic signs and the other 2 had bilateral clinical signs and unilateral radiographic signs. Seven horses had surgery at the time of clinical and radiographic diagnosis; 5 subsequently raced, 1 is in training and 1 has persistent problems. Of 11 cases not operated initially, 6 raced, 3 had no follow-up, 1 became a jumper and 1 was operated later. In the 1990 foal crop, 13 of 120 foals were diagnosed with femoropatellar OCD. The average age at diagnosis was 9 months. Nine of the foals had radiographic lesions, 3 had equivocal radiographic lesions (1 progressed to an obvious lesion) and 1 had no radiographic lesions of the femoropatellar joint (but did have them in the fetlocks). All but one horse were treated conservatively. Of the horses with radiographic lesions initially, 2 have raced, 2 are still unraced, 3 have lameness and 2 were used for non-racing careers. One horse had equivocal lesions initially but these progressed. In the 1991 foal crop, there were 16 cases of femoropatellar OCD diagnosed out of 125 foals. The average age at clinical recognition was 6 months. Ten horses had radiographic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis, 5 had no radiographic lesions initially but subsequently developed them, and 1 never had a radiographic lesion.

1206,67ae6ca439a3abbef9b0f4b6a3ce6e2f605ed5ee,Case-control study to investigate risk factors for horse falls in hurdle racing in England and Wales,"Between March 1, 2000 and August 31, 2001, a case-control study was conducted on 12 racecourses in England and Wales to identify and quantify the risk factors associated with horse falls in hurdle races. The cases and controls were defined so that variables relating to the horse, the jockey, the race and racecourse, and the jump could be considered. The cases were defined as a jumping effort at a hurdle flight that resulted in a fall, and the controls were defined as a successful jump over a hurdle at any of the 12 racecourses within 14 days before or after the case fall.

Transplantation of MSCs to treat cardiac disease has always been predicated on the hypothesis that these cells would engraft, differentiate and replace damaged cardiac tissues. However, experimental or clinical observations so far have failed to demonstrate a therapeutically relevant level of transplanted MSC engraftment or differentiation. Instead, they indicate that transplanted MSCs secrete factors to reduce tissue injury and/or enhance tissue repair. Here we review the evidences supporting this hypothesis including the recent identification of exosome as a therapeutic agent in MSC secretion. In particular, we will discuss the potential and practicality of using this relatively novel entity as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of cardiac disease, particularly acute myocardial infarction.",Medicine,1,0,cardiovascular disease major target many experimental stem cellbased therapy mesenchymal stem cell msc widely used therapy transplantation msc treat cardiac disease always predicated hypothesis cell would engraft differentiate replace damaged cardiac tissue however experimental clinical observation far failed demonstrate therapeutically relevant level transplanted msc engraftment differentiation instead indicate transplanted msc secrete factor reduce tissue injury andor enhance tissue repair review evidence supporting hypothesis including recent identification exosome therapeutic agent msc secretion particular discus potential practicality using relatively novel entity therapeutic modality treatment cardiac disease particularly acute myocardial infarction

The cycloid psychoses with low heritability and a good long‐term prognosis were found to be significantly associated with first‐trimester respiratory infection (i.e. influenza and febrile cold). Furthermore, maternal infection seems to predict an early onset in cycloids. In manic depression, we failed to identify a significant link with maternal gestational infection or other obstetric complications. These findings are discussed in the light of our previous reports of an excess of maternal gestational infections during the second trimester in chronic schizophrenics. Our results suggest that the exogenously induced disturbances of fetal brain maturation during the first trimester of gestation caused by maternal respiratory infection via live virus or disturbed maternal immune response are involved in the aetiology of cycloid psychoses.",Medicine,3,0,using structured interview mother patient cycloid psychosis manic depression control mother case investigated order ass occurrence maternal gestational infection obstetric complication pregnancy affected child cycloid psychosis low heritability good longterm prognosis found significantly associated firsttrimester respiratory infection ie influenza febrile cold furthermore maternal infection seems predict early onset cycloid manic depression failed identify significant link maternal gestational infection obstetric complication finding discussed light previous report excess maternal gestational infection second trimester chronic schizophrenic result suggest exogenously induced disturbance fetal brain maturation first trimester gestation caused maternal respiratory infection via live virus disturbed maternal immune response involved aetiology cycloid psychosis

Since there is no diagnostic test for tics, the clinical recognition of phenomenology is essential for proper diagnosis. Some, and possibly most, motor tics are preceded by a premonitory urge or sensation that is relieved by the execution of the tic and thus can be difficult to differentiate from compulsions, hence the term compulsive tic. In the schema of categorization of movements, most tics can be classified as either unvoluntaryin response to an inner sensory stimulus or to an unwanted feeling compulsionor involuntarytics that are usually suppressible. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical, anatomical, and physiologic substrates for the different forms of tics. Finally, the relationship between tics and comorbid conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit with hyperactivity needs to be further explored.",Medicine,3,0,motor phonic tic represent clinic hallmark tourette syndrome since diagnostic test tic clinical recognition phenomenology essential proper diagnosis possibly motor tic preceded premonitory urge sensation relieved execution tic thus difficult differentiate compulsion hence term compulsive tic schema categorization movement tic classified either unvoluntaryin response inner sensory stimulus unwanted feeling compulsionor involuntarytics usually suppressible study needed elucidate clinical anatomical physiologic substrate different form tic finally relationship tic comorbid condition obsessivecompulsive disorder attention deficit hyperactivity need explored

As common as they are, they are not a simple undertaking and should be approached with the same depth of preparation as any other surgical procedure.

These are: obtain consent, expose a dental radiograph, obtain proper lighting and visualization, administer proper pain management, cut the gingival attachment, elevate carefully, remove the tooth, perform alveoplasty, and close. Multi-root teeth require sectioning into single-rooted pieces, which are then treated as single-root extractions.

Aims To find out whether obstetric complications are more common in affective psychoses than matched controls. Method Two hundred and seventeen probands with an in-patient diagnosis of affective psychosis who had been born in Scotland in 1971–74, and a further 84 born in 1975–78, were closely matched with controls and the incidence of obstetric complications in the two compared using obstetric data recorded in a set format shortly after birth. Results Abnormal presentation of the foetus was the only complication significantly more common in the affective probands in the 1971–74 birth cohort and artificial rupture of the membranes was the only event more common in the probands in the 1975–78 cohort. Both are probably chance findings.

A presumptive diagnosis of severe cartilage damage was made because the horse had a history of infectious arthritis involving the left metacarpophalangeal joint. Arthroscopic evaluation revealed what was presumed to be a large villonodular lesion. The mass was surgically removed, and the horse was treated with procaine penicillin G, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, phenylbutazone, and polysulfated glycosaminoglycans and eventually returned to racing. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a bed of granulation tissue covered with keratinized epithelium.

After the introduction of asepsis these toxic manifestations became less frequent, but then interest centered on the anesthetics. Psychoses following anesthesia with chloroform, ether and nitrous oxide were described.

Kraepelin, provides a solid foundation for contemporary psychiatry. Kraepelin's term, dementia praecox, was subsequently succeeded by E. Bleulev's term schizophrenia which represented a somewhat larger concept than the former. Since Bleuler's time, the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been made chiefly on the basis of psychological characteristics shown in the clinical picture rather than on the clinical course and outcome of the illness since its inception. As a result, the concept of the illness has been expanded and its boundaries have been obscured. Therefore, it seems only natural that contemporary views regarding the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are frequently in disagreement and are matters of controversy. This problemthe classification of schizophrenia was a subject matter of importance during the International Psychiatric Congress held in Zurich in 1957. The most troublesome of all diagnostic problems in our daily practice seems to be with the group of illnesses which show atypical features attributable to neither schizophrenia nor manic depressive psychosis.

Instead of the order being defined by the position on the paper, an ordering subscript is introduced so that AsBs′ means AB or BA depending on whether s exceeds s′ or vice versa.

Connection to the theory of functionals is discussed in an appendix. Illustrative applications to quantum mechanics are made. In quantum electrodynamics it permits a simple formal understanding of the interrelation of the various present day theoretical formulations.

The last possibility is contentious but of special interest in view of the recent detection of black hole mergers by LIGO/Virgo. PBHs might have important consequences and resolve various cosmological conundra even if they account for only a small fraction of the dark matter density. In particular, those larger than 103 M⊙ could generate cosmological structures through the seed or Poisson effect, thereby alleviating some problems associated with the standard cold dark matter scenario, and sufficiently large PBHs might provide seeds for the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

Although observational estimates are available for a small proportion of PNe, based on statistical parallax and the like, such distances are very poorly determined for the majority of galactic PNe. In particular, estimates of so-called ‘statistical’ distance appear to differ by factors of ∼2.7. 
 
 
 
We point out that there is a well-defined correlation between the 5-GHz luminosity of the sources, L5, and their brightness temperatures, TB. This represents a different trend to those investigated in previous statistical analyses, and permits us to determine independent distances to a further 449 outflows. These distances are shown to be closely comparable to those determined using a TB–R correlation, providing that the latter trend is taken to be non-linear. 
 
 
 
This non-linearity in the TB–R plane has not been noted in previous analyses, and is likely responsible for the broad (and conflicting) ranges of distance that have previously been published. 
 
 
 
Finally, we point out that there is a close accord between observed trends within the L5–TB and TB–R planes, and the variation predicted through nebular evolutionary modelling. This is used to suggest that observational biases are probably modest, and that our revised distance scale is reasonably trustworthy.",Physics,2,0,distance planetary nebula pne still quite uncertain although observational estimate available small proportion pne based statistical parallax like distance poorly determined majority galactic pne particular estimate socalled statistical distance appear differ factor point welldefined correlation ghz luminosity source l brightness temperature tb represents different trend investigated previous statistical analysis permit u determine independent distance outflow distance shown closely comparable determined using tbr correlation providing latter trend taken nonlinear nonlinearity tbr plane noted previous analysis likely responsible broad conflicting range distance previously published finally point close accord observed trend within ltb tbr plane variation predicted nebular evolutionary modelling used suggest observational bias probably modest revised distance scale reasonably trustworthy

By averaging over the hidden parameters, we then recover the usual statistical results of quantum mechanics as a special case.

Phase mask coronagraphy is a recent technique aiming at accommodating both high dynamic and high angular resolution imaging of faint sources around bright objects such as exoplanets orbiting their parent stars or host galaxies of active galactic nuclei. Subwavelength gratings are known to be artificially birefringent. Their unique dispersive characteristics can be controlled through the grating geometry in order to synthesize achromatic phase shifters. We show that implementing them in a ring-shaped way produces a fully symmetric and achromatic coronagraph without any gap or ""dead zone.""

There is also a second adiabatic mode, for which $\mathcal{R}$ vanishes for a large wavelength, and in general there may be nonadiabatic modes as well. These conclusions apply in all eras and whatever the constituents of the universe, under only a mild technical assumption about the wavelength dependence of the field equations for a large wavelength. In the absence of anisotropic inertia, the perturbations in the adiabatic modes are given for a large wavelength by universal formulas in terms of the Robertson-Walker scale factor.

Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory techniques, we derive three different first law relations including variations in the cosmological constant, and associated Smarr formulas that are satisfied by such spacetimes. Each first law introduces a different thermodynamic volume conjugate to the cosmological constant. We examine the relation between these thermodynamic volumes and associated geometric volumes in a number of examples, including Kerr-dS black holes in all dimensions and Kerr-Newman-dS black holes in D = 4. We also show that the Chong-Cvetic-Lu-Pope solution of D = 5 minimal supergravity, analytically continued to positive cosmological constant, describes black hole solutions of the Einstein-Chern-Simons theory and include such charged asymptotically de Sitter black holes in our analysis. In all these examples we find that the particular thermodynamic volume associated with the region between the black hole and cosmological horizons is equal to the naive geometric volume. Isoperimetric inequalities, which hold in the examples considered, are formulated for the different thermodynamic volumes and conjectured to remain valid for all asymptotically de Sitter black holes. In particular, in all examples considered, we find that for fixed volume of the observable universe, the entropy is increased by adding black holes.

Here we present spectroscopy of a transit of HD 147506b and assess the spin-orbit alignment via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

Demonstration of an Active Single-mode Fiber Injection Unit,"High-dispersion coronagraphy (HDC) optimally combines high-contrast imaging techniques such as adaptive optics/wavefront control plus coronagraphy to high spectral resolution spectroscopy. HDC is a critical pathway toward fully characterizing exoplanet atmospheres across a broad range of masses from giant gaseous planets down to Earth-like planets. In addition to determining the molecular composition of exoplanet atmospheres, HDC also enables Doppler mapping of atmosphere inhomogeneities (temperature, clouds, wind), as well as precise measurements of exoplanet rotational velocities. Here, we demonstrate an innovative concept for injecting the directly imaged planet light into a single-mode fiber, linking a high-contrast adaptively corrected coronagraph to a high-resolution spectrograph (diffraction-limited or not). Our laboratory demonstration includes three key milestones: close-to-theoretical injection efficiency, accurate pointing and tracking, and on-fiber coherent modulation and speckle nulling of spurious starlight signal coupling into the fiber. Using the extreme modal selectivity of single-mode fibers, we also demonstrated speckle suppression gains that outperform conventional image-based speckle nulling by at least two orders of magnitude.",Physics,3,0,highdispersion coronagraphy hdc optimally combine highcontrast imaging technique adaptive opticswavefront control plus coronagraphy high spectral resolution spectroscopy hdc critical pathway toward fully characterizing exoplanet atmosphere across broad range mass giant gaseous planet earthlike planet addition determining molecular composition exoplanet atmosphere hdc also enables doppler mapping atmosphere inhomogeneity temperature cloud wind well precise measurement exoplanet rotational velocity demonstrate innovative concept injecting directly imaged planet light singlemode fiber linking highcontrast adaptively corrected coronagraph highresolution spectrograph diffractionlimited laboratory demonstration includes three key milestone closetotheoretical injection efficiency accurate pointing tracking onfiber coherent modulation speckle nulling spurious starlight signal coupling fiber using extreme modal selectivity singlemode fiber also demonstrated speckle suppression gain outperform conventional imagebased speckle nulling least two order magnitude

This ensemble may be taken as the statistical. This enables an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics with which is associated that classical picture. Such a formulation leads, however, if developed straightforwardly according to the picture, to a theoretical scheme quite different from that of ordinary quantum mechanics. concerning the problems other than the equation of motion. Furthermore, this formulation is not applicable to Fermions when spin, or exclusion principle is taken jrlto account. Bohm's recent renewed form of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics referring to this formulation is criticized in several points. On this formulation we can construct a singular ensemble which is shown to correspond to the tranformation kernel of the wave function to infinitesimally later instant, and thus a connection between this formulation and that of Feyninan's is taken out.

Recently, the possibility has been raised that dark matter halos might be singular in the sense that the dark matter density $\rho$ could increase monotonically with radius $r$ down to a very small distance from the center of galaxies or clusters. Such central cusps in the dark matter density could lead to a high flux of gamma rays from WIMP dark matter annihilation. Here we analyze two possibilities that have been discussed in the literature, $\rho \propto r^{-n}$ with $n \approx 1\ {\rm or}\ 2$, and point out that such density profiles are excluded by gravitional lensing analyses on cluster scales and by the rotation curves of gas-rich, halo-dominated dwarf spirals on small scales. We also point out that if spiral galaxies form by gas infall inside dark matter halos, as they are expected to do in any hierarchical clustering model, such profiles almost always lead to falling rotation curves after infall, contrary to observations.",Physics,3,0,distribution dark matter around galactic cluster halo usually assumed approximately isothermal nonzero core radius expected order size visible matter distribution recently possibility raised dark matter halo might singular sense dark matter density rho could increase monotonically radius r small distance center galaxy cluster central cusp dark matter density could lead high flux gamma ray wimp dark matter annihilation analyze two possibility discussed literature rho propto rn n approx rm point density profile excluded gravitional lensing analysis cluster scale rotation curve gasrich halodominated dwarf spiral small scale also point spiral galaxy form gas infall inside dark matter halo expected hierarchical clustering model profile almost always lead falling rotation curve infall contrary observation

Discrete time evolution,"Using general features of recent quantizations of the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology, a dynamical interpretation of the constraint equation as evolution equation is presented. This involves a transformation from the connection to a dreibein representation and the selection of an internal time variable. Due to the discrete nature of geometrical quantities in loop quantum gravity, time also turns out to be discrete leading to a difference rather than differential evolution equation. Furthermore, evolving observables are discussed within this framework, which enables an investigation of physical spectra of geometrical quantities. In particular, the physical volume spectrum is proven to equal the discrete kinematical volume spectrum in loop quantum cosmology.",Physics,0,0,using general feature recent quantization hamiltonian constraint loop quantum gravity loop quantum cosmology dynamical interpretation constraint equation evolution equation presented involves transformation connection dreibein representation selection internal time variable due discrete nature geometrical quantity loop quantum gravity time also turn discrete leading difference rather differential evolution equation furthermore evolving observables discussed within framework enables investigation physical spectrum geometrical quantity particular physical volume spectrum proven equal discrete kinematical volume spectrum loop quantum cosmology

While capable of identifying grazing binary eclipses, this technique cannot reliably identify blends, a chance overlap of a faint background eclipsing binary with an ordinary foreground star. Blends generally have no observable radial velocity shifts, as the foreground star is brighter by several magnitudes and therefore dominates the spectrum, but their combined light can produce events that closely resemble those produced by transiting exoplanets. The radial velocity technique takes advantage of the mass difference between planets and stars to classify exoplanet candidates. However, the existence of blends renders this difference an unreliable discriminator. Another difference must therefore be utilized for this classification - the physical size of the transiting body. Due to the dependence of limb darkening on color, planets and stars produce subtly different transit shapes. These differences can be relatively weak, little more than 1/10th the transit depth. However, the presence of even small color differences between the individual components of the blend increases this difference. This paper shows that this color difference is capable of discriminating between exoplanets and blends reliably, theoretically capable of classifying even terrestrial-class transits, unlike the radial velocity technique.",Physics,1,0,radial velocity technique currently used classify transiting object capable identifying grazing binary eclipse technique reliably identify blend chance overlap faint background eclipsing binary ordinary foreground star blend generally observable radial velocity shift foreground star brighter several magnitude therefore dominates spectrum combined light produce event closely resemble produced transiting exoplanets radial velocity technique take advantage mass difference planet star classify exoplanet candidate however existence blend render difference unreliable discriminator another difference must therefore utilized classification physical size transiting body due dependence limb darkening color planet star produce subtly different transit shape difference relatively weak little th transit depth however presence even small color difference individual component blend increase difference paper show color difference capable discriminating exoplanets blend reliably theoretically capable classifying even terrestrialclass transit unlike radial velocity technique

In particular, we investigate the consequences of supernova-driven winds that expel a large fraction of the baryonic component from a dwarf galaxy disk after a vigorous episode of star formation. We show that this sudden loss of mass leads to the formation of a core in the dark matter density profile, although the original halo is modeled by a coreless (Hernquist) profile. The core radius thus created is a sensitive function of the mass and radius of the baryonic disk being blown up. The loss of a disk with mass and size consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis constraints and angular momentum considerations imprints a core radius which is only a small fraction of the original scale-length of the halo. These small perturbations are, however, enough to reconcile the rotation curves of dwarf irregulars with the density profiles of haloes formed in the standard CDM scenario.",Physics,3,0,use nbody simulation examine effect mass outflow density profile cold dark matter cdm halo surrounding dwarf galaxy particular investigate consequence supernovadriven wind expel large fraction baryonic component dwarf galaxy disk vigorous episode star formation show sudden loss mass lead formation core dark matter density profile although original halo modeled coreless hernquist profile core radius thus created sensitive function mass radius baryonic disk blown loss disk mass size consistent primordial nucleosynthesis constraint angular momentum consideration imprint core radius small fraction original scalelength halo small perturbation however enough reconcile rotation curve dwarf irregular density profile halo formed standard cdm scenario

The subcluster is identified as a smaller cluster that has just undergone initial infall and pass-through of the primary cluster and has been previously identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been separated from the galaxies by ram pressure-stripping during the pass-through. The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy concentration, although the position is consistent with the galaxy centroid within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and is offset from the X-ray halo at 3.4 σ significance, and we determine that the mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of dark matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND); based on the observed gravitational shear-optical light ratios and the mass peak-X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime would have a total mass that is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.",Physics,2,0,present weaklensing mass reconstruction interacting cluster e detect main cluster subcluster subcluster identified smaller cluster undergone initial infall passthrough primary cluster previously identified optical survey xray study xray gas separated galaxy ram pressurestripping passthrough detected mass peak located xray peak galaxy concentration although position consistent galaxy centroid within error mass reconstruction find mass peak main cluster good spatial agreement cluster galaxy offset xray halo σ significance determine masstolight ratio two component consistent relaxed cluster observed offset lensing mass peak peak dominant visible mass component xray gas directly demonstrate presence dominance dark matter cluster proof dark matter existence hold true even assumption modified newtonian dynamic mond based observed gravitational shearoptical light ratio mass peakxray gas offset dark matter component mond regime would total mass least equal baryonic mass system

Such a signal may be understood as an indication for an unexpected cooling of the hydrogen gas during or prior to the so called Cosmic Dawn era. Here we explore the possibility that dark matter cooled the gas through velocity-dependent, Rutherford-like interactions. We argue that such interactions require a light mediator that is highly constrained by 5th force experiments and limits from stellar cooling. Consequently, only a hidden or the visible photon can in principle mediate such a force. Neutral hydrogen thus plays a sub-leading role and the cooling occurs via the residual free electrons and protons. We find that these two scenarios are strongly constrained by the predicted dark matter self-interactions and by limits on millicharged dark matter respectively. We conclude that the 21-cm absorption line is unlikely to be the result of gas cooling via the scattering with a dominant component of the dark matter. An order 1\% subcomponent of millicharged dark matter remains a viable explanation.",Physics,3,0,recently edge collaboration reported anomalous absorption signal skyaveraged cm spectrum around z signal may understood indication unexpected cooling hydrogen gas prior called cosmic dawn era explore possibility dark matter cooled gas velocitydependent rutherfordlike interaction argue interaction require light mediator highly constrained th force experiment limit stellar cooling consequently hidden visible photon principle mediate force neutral hydrogen thus play subleading role cooling occurs via residual free electron proton find two scenario strongly constrained predicted dark matter selfinteractions limit millicharged dark matter respectively conclude cm absorption line unlikely result gas cooling via scattering dominant component dark matter order subcomponent millicharged dark matter remains viable explanation

These are shown to have morphologies which are sometimes quite different from those observed in the visible, with much of the emission arising outside the ionized shells. There is also evidence for a change in nebular sizes between the differing photometric bands. An analysis of mid-infrared (MIR) colours suggests that many nebulae have dust/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission components, and it seems likely that longer wave MIR fluxes (in particular) are associated with PAH emission features. Such features are likely to be associated, in addition, with photodissociative regimes, where shock fragmentation of dust may lead to the replenishment of smaller PAH grains.

Bound stellar systems with radii of a few hundred parsecs, masses ≲ 109 M⊙ and relaxation times of 1011 − 1012 yr may form from these. These spheroidal dwarf galaxies contain old stars from the pre-merger galaxy and much younger stars formed in the massive star clusters, and possibly from later gas accretion events. The possibility that star formation in the outer regions of gas-rich tidal tails may also lead to superclusters is raised.

The last scattering temperature is lower than the kinetic decoupling temperature by one order of magnitude.

Type A dwarfs surround the host approximately spherically, while type B dwarfs are typically correlated in phasespace. Type B dwarfs must exist in any cosmological theory in which galaxies interact. Only one type of dwarf galaxy is observed to exist on the baryonic Tully-Fisher plot and in the radius-mass plane. The Milky Way satellite system forms a vast phase-space-correlated structure that includes globular clusters and stellar and gaseous streams. Other galaxies also have phase-space correlated satellite systems. Therefore, The Dual Dwarf Galaxy Theorem is falsified by observation and dynamically relevant cold or warm DM cannot exist. It is shown that the SMoC is incompatible with a large set of other extragalactic observations. Other theoretical solutions to cosmological observations exist. In particular, alone the empirical mass-discrepancy—acceleration correlation constitutes convincing evidence that galactic-scale dynamics must be Milgromian.

In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted.",Physics,3,0,method following fragmentation simulation time using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph presented normal sph simulation collapse fragmentation molecular cloud highdensity region gas form protostars represented many particle small separation highdensity region require small time step limiting time simulation followed thus end result fragmentation never definitively ascertained comparison cloud fragmentation calculation observed characteristic stellar system made paper highdensity region replaced single nongaseous particle appropriate boundary condition contains mass region accretes infalling mass enables evolution cloud resulting protostars followed many orbit original cloud mass accreted

We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300 000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km s(-1), an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass.

1459,248020659431375d52579d8de8cb8fe7bbb012bb,Far-Ultraviolet Radiation from Elliptical Galaxies,"▪ Abstract Far-ultraviolet radiation is a ubiquitous, if unanticipated, phenomenon in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges. It is the most variable photometric feature associated with old stellar populations. Recent observational and theoretical evidence shows that it is produced mainly by low-mass, small-envelope, helium-burning stars in extreme horizontal branch and subsequent phases of evolution. These are probably descendants of the dominant, metal rich population of the galaxies. Their lifetime UV outputs are remarkably sensitive to their physical properties and hence to the age and the helium and metal abundances of their parents. UV spectra are therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics of old stellar populations, although their calibration requires a much improved understanding of giant branch mass loss, helium enrichment, and atmospheric diffusion.",Physics,3,0,abstract farultraviolet radiation ubiquitous unanticipated phenomenon elliptical galaxy earlytype spiral bulge variable photometric feature associated old stellar population recent observational theoretical evidence show produced mainly lowmass smallenvelope heliumburning star extreme horizontal branch subsequent phase evolution probably descendant dominant metal rich population galaxy lifetime uv output remarkably sensitive physical property hence age helium metal abundance parent uv spectrum therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics old stellar population although calibration requires much improved understanding giant branch mass loss helium enrichment atmospheric diffusion

Our analysis allows us to (1) refine Kepler-7b's relatively large geometric albedo of Ag = 0.35 ± 0.02, (2) place upper limits on Kepler-7b thermal emission that remains undetected in both Spitzer bandpasses and (3) report a westward shift in the Kepler optical phase curve. We argue that Kepler-7b's visible flux cannot be due to thermal emission or Rayleigh scattering from H2 molecules. We therefore conclude that high altitude, optically reflective clouds located west from the substellar point are present in its atmosphere. We find that a silicate-based cloud composition is a possible candidate. Kepler-7b exhibits several properties that may make it particularly amenable to cloud formation in its upper atmosphere. These include a hot deep atmosphere that avoids a cloud cold trap, very low surface gravity to suppress cloud sedimentation, and a planetary equilibrium temperature in a range that allows for silicate clouds to potentially form in the visible atmosphere probed by Kepler. Our analysis does not only present evidence of optically thick clouds on Kepler-7b but also yields the first map of clouds in an exoplanet atmosphere.",Physics,3,0,present new visible infrared observation hot jupiter keplerb determine atmospheric property analysis allows u refine keplerbs relatively large geometric albedo ag place upper limit keplerb thermal emission remains undetected spitzer bandpasses report westward shift kepler optical phase curve argue keplerbs visible flux due thermal emission rayleigh scattering h molecule therefore conclude high altitude optically reflective cloud located west substellar point present atmosphere find silicatebased cloud composition possible candidate keplerb exhibit several property may make particularly amenable cloud formation upper atmosphere include hot deep atmosphere avoids cloud cold trap low surface gravity suppress cloud sedimentation planetary equilibrium temperature range allows silicate cloud potentially form visible atmosphere probed kepler analysis present evidence optically thick cloud keplerb also yield first map cloud exoplanet atmosphere

We find a way to explicitly fulfill the conditions for anomaly freedom and we give explicit expressions for the counter terms. Surprisingly, the -scheme naturally arises in this procedure.

Molecular nitrogen (N2) constitutes the largest fraction of Earth's atmosphere and is likely to be a major constituent of many terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. Due to its lack of significant absorption features, N2 is extremely difficult to remotely detect. However, N2 produces an N2–N2 collisional pair, (N2)2, which is spectrally active. Here we report the detection of (N2)2 in Earth's disk-integrated spectrum. By comparing spectra from NASA's EPOXI mission to synthetic spectra from the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth model, we find that (N2)2 absorption produces a ∼35% decrease in flux at 4.15 μm. Quantifying N2 could provide a means of determining bulk atmospheric composition for terrestrial exoplanets and could rule out abiotic O2 generation, which is possible in rarefied atmospheres. To explore the potential effects of (N2)2 in exoplanet spectra, we used radiative transfer models to generate synthetic emission and transit transmission spectra of self-consistent N2–CO2–H2O atmospheres, and analytic N2–H2 and N2–H2–CO2 atmospheres. We show that (N2)2 absorption in the wings of the 4.3 μm CO2 band is strongly dependent on N2 partial pressures above 0.5 bar and can significantly widen this band in thick N2 atmospheres. The (N2)2 transit transmission signal is up to 10 ppm for an Earth-size planet with an N2-dominated atmosphere orbiting within the habitable zone of an M5V star and could be substantially larger for planets with significant H2 mixing ratios.",Physics,3,0,characterizing bulk atmosphere terrestrial planet important determining surface pressure potential habitability molecular nitrogen n constitutes largest fraction earth atmosphere likely major constituent many terrestrial exoplanet atmosphere due lack significant absorption feature n extremely difficult remotely detect however n produce nn collisional pair n spectrally active report detection n earth diskintegrated spectrum comparing spectrum nasa epoxi mission synthetic spectrum nasa astrobiology institute virtual planetary laboratory threedimensional spectral earth model find n absorption produce decrease flux μm quantifying n could provide mean determining bulk atmospheric composition terrestrial exoplanets could rule abiotic generation possible rarefied atmosphere explore potential effect n exoplanet spectrum used radiative transfer model generate synthetic emission transit transmission spectrum selfconsistent ncoho atmosphere analytic nh nhco atmosphere show n absorption wing μm co band strongly dependent n partial pressure bar significantly widen band thick n atmosphere n transit transmission signal ppm earthsize planet ndominated atmosphere orbiting within habitable zone mv star could substantially larger planet significant h mixing ratio

These instabilities constitute a fascinating nonlinear system where fluid and kinetic nonlinearities can appear on an equal footing. In addition to basic science, Alfven instabilities are of practical importance, as the expulsion of energetic particles can damage the walls of a confinement device. Because of rapid dispersion, shear Alfven waves that are part of the continuous spectrum are rarely destabilized. However, because the index of refraction is periodic in toroidally confined plasmas, gaps appear in the continuous spectrum. At spatial locations where the radial group velocity vanishes, weakly damped discrete modes appear in these gaps. These eigenmodes are of two types.

This event is an unique opportunity to assess the feasibility of the atmospheric characterisation of Earth-size exoplanets near the habitable zone with the transmission spectroscopy technique and provide an invaluable proxy for the atmosphere of such a planet. In this letter, we provide a theoretical transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of Venus that could be tested with spectroscopic observations during the 2012 transit. This is done using radiative transfer across Venus' atmosphere, with inputs from in-situ missions such as Venus Express and theoretical models. The transmission spectrum covers a range of 0.1-5 {\mu}m and probes the limb between 70 and 150 km in altitude. It is dominated in UV by carbon dioxide absorption producing a broad transit signal of ~20 ppm as seen from Earth, and from 0.2 to 2.7 {\mu}m by Mie extinction (~5 ppm at 0.8 {\mu}m) caused by droplets of sulfuric acid composing an upper haze layer above the main deck of clouds.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent with Einstein’s theory of general relativity, constraining the presence of certain parametric anomalies in the signal. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of anomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on nonstandard theoretical physics mechanisms that could otherwise have affected the observed signals. We find that these gravitational wave events constrain a plethora of mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational waves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into large extra dimensions, the variability of Newton’s constant, the speed of gravity, a modified dispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence principle. Though other observations limit many of these mechanisms already, GW150914 and GW151226 are unique in that they are direct probes of dynamical strong-field gravity and of gravitational wave propagation. We also show that GW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives to Kerr black holes. We argue, however, that the true potential for GW150914 to both rule out exotic objects and constrain physics beyond general relativity is severely limited by the lack of understanding of the coalescence regime in almost all relevant modified gravity theories. This event thus significantly raises the bar that these theories have to pass, both in terms of having a sound theoretical underpinning and reaching the minimal level of being able to solve the equations of motion for binary merger events. We conclude with a discussion of the additional inferences that can be drawn if the lower-confidence observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to GW150914 holds true, or such a coincidence is observed with future events; this would provide dramatic constraints on the speed of gravity and gravitational Lorentz violation.",Physics,2,0,gravitational wave observation gw gw advanced ligo provide first opportunity learn physic extreme gravity environment coalescing binary black hole ligo scientific collaboration virgo collaboration verified observation consistent einstein theory general relativity constraining presence certain parametric anomaly signal paper expands analysis larger class anomaly highlighting inference drawn nonstandard theoretical physic mechanism could otherwise affected observed signal find gravitational wave event constrain plethora mechanism associated generation propagation gravitational wave including activation scalar field gravitational leakage large extra dimension variability newton constant speed gravity modified dispersion relation gravitational lorentz violation strong equivalence principle though observation limit many mechanism already gw gw unique direct probe dynamical strongfield gravity gravitational wave propagation also show gw constrains inferred property exotic compact object alternative kerr black hole argue however true potential gw rule exotic object constrain physic beyond general relativity severely limited lack understanding coalescence regime almost relevant modified gravity theory event thus significantly raise bar theory pas term sound theoretical underpinning reaching minimal level able solve equation motion binary merger event conclude discussion additional inference drawn lowerconfidence observation electromagnetic counterpart gw hold true coincidence observed future event would provide dramatic constraint speed gravity gravitational lorentz violation

Wave transience, forcing and dissipation are taken into account in a very general way. The theory makes it possible to discuss the latitudinal (y) and vertical (z) dependence of ∂ū/∂t qualitatively and calculate it directly from an approximate knowledge of the wave structure. For equatorial modes it reveals that the y profile of ∂ū/∂t is strongly dependent on the nature of the forcing or dissipation mechanism. A by-product of the theory is a far-reaching generalization of the theorems of Charney-Drazin, Dickinson and Holton on the forcing of ∂ū/∂t by conservative linear waves. Implications for the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere are discussed. Graphs of y profiles of ∂ū/∂t are given for the equatorial waves considered in the recent analysis of observational data...",Physics,3,0,abstract using new generalization eliassenpalm relation discus zonalmeanflow tendency ūt due wave stratified rotating atmosphere particular attention equatorially trapped mode wave transience forcing dissipation taken account general way theory make possible discus latitudinal vertical z dependence ūt qualitatively calculate directly approximate knowledge wave structure equatorial mode reveals profile ūt strongly dependent nature forcing dissipation mechanism byproduct theory farreaching generalization theorem charneydrazin dickinson holton forcing ūt conservative linear wave implication quasibiennial oscillation equatorial stratosphere discussed graph profile ūt given equatorial wave considered recent analysis observational data

Such a measurement requires very precise photometry of a transiting system, fully sampling many phases of the secondary eclipse. Space-based optical photometry of the transiting system HD 209458 from the MOST (Microvariablity and Oscillations of Stars) satellite, spanning 14 and 44 days in 2004 and 2005, respectively, allows us to set a sensitive limit on the optical eclipse of the hot exosolar giant planet in this system. Our best fit to the observations yields a flux ratio of the planet and star of 7 ± 9 ppm (parts per million), which corresponds to a geometric albedo through the MOST bandpass (400-700 nm) of Ag = 0.038 ± 0.045.

Three classes of hot Jupiter creation hypotheses have been proposed: in situ formation, disk migration, and high-eccentricity tidal migration.

We consider here the possibility that these two problems are related, and review some theoretical scenarios which offer common solutions. A simple possibility is that the dark matter particle emerges in minimal realizations of the seesaw mechanism, as in the majoron and sterile neutrino scenarios. We present the theoretical motivation for both models and discuss their phenomenology, confronting the predictions of these scenarios with cosmological and astrophysical observations. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the stability of dark matter originates from a flavor symmetry of the leptonic sector.

This ALP scenario is well-motivated by the observed morphology of the 3.55 keV flux. For this scenario we study the expected flux from dark matter decay in the galactic halos of both the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31). The Milky Way magnetic field is asymmetric about the galactic centre, and so the resulting 3.55 keV flux morphology differs significantly from the case of direct dark matter decay to photons. However the Milky Way magnetic field is not large enough to generate an observable signal, even with ASTRO-H. In contrast, M31 has optimal conditions for a → γ conversion and the intrinsic signal from M31 becomes two orders of magnitude larger than for the Milky Way, comparable to that from clusters and consistent with observations.",Physics,3,0,explore scenario recently observed kev photon line arises dark matter decay axionlike particle alp energy kev convert photon astrophysical magnetic field alp scenario wellmotivated observed morphology kev flux scenario study expected flux dark matter decay galactic halo milky way andromeda milky way magnetic field asymmetric galactic centre resulting kev flux morphology differs significantly case direct dark matter decay photon however milky way magnetic field large enough generate observable signal even astroh contrast optimal condition γ conversion intrinsic signal becomes two order magnitude larger milky way comparable cluster consistent observation

Previously it has been shown that non-local ghostfree higher-derivative modifications of Einstein gravity in the ultra-violet regime can admit non-singular bouncing solutions. In this paper we study in more details the dynamical properties of the equations of motion for these theories of gravity in presence of positive and negative cosmological constants and radiation. We find stable inflationary attractor solutions in the presence of a positive cosmological constant which renders inflation geodesically complete, while in the presence of a negative cosmological constant a cyclic universe emerges.

The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has verified that this observation is consistent with General Relativity, constraining the presence of parametric anomalies in the signal. This paper expands this analysis to a larger class of anomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard theoretical physics mechanisms that would affect the signal. We find that GW150914 constrains a plethora of mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational waves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into large extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, the speed of gravity, a modified dispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence principle. Unlike other observations that limit these mechanisms, GW150914 is a direct probe of dynamical strong-field gravity and gravitational wave propagation. We also show that GW150914 constrains the properties of exotic compact object alternatives to Kerr black holes. The true potential for GW150914 to both constrain exotic objects and physics beyond General Relativity is limited by the lack of understanding of the dynamical strong field in almost all modified gravity theories. GW150914 thus raises the bar that these theories must pass, both in terms of having a sound theoretical underpinning, and the minimal level to which the corresponding equations of motion must be solved in binary coalescences. We conclude with a discussion of additional inferences that can be drawn from smaller-confidence observations, such as the LVT151012 trigger and electromagnetic counterparts to GW150914, the latter of which would produce dramatic constraints on the speed of gravity and gravitational Lorentz violation.",Physics,1,0,gravitationalwave observation gw advanced ligo provides first opportunity learn physic extreme gravity coalescing binary black hole ligovirgo collaboration verified observation consistent general relativity constraining presence parametric anomaly signal paper expands analysis larger class anomaly highlighting inference drawn nonstandard theoretical physic mechanism would affect signal find gw constrains plethora mechanism associated generation propagation gravitational wave including activation scalar field gravitational leakage large extra dimension variability newton constant speed gravity modified dispersion relation gravitational lorentz violation strong equivalence principle unlike observation limit mechanism gw direct probe dynamical strongfield gravity gravitational wave propagation also show gw constrains property exotic compact object alternative kerr black hole true potential gw constrain exotic object physic beyond general relativity limited lack understanding dynamical strong field almost modified gravity theory gw thus raise bar theory must pas term sound theoretical underpinning minimal level corresponding equation motion must solved binary coalescence conclude discussion additional inference drawn smallerconfidence observation lvt trigger electromagnetic counterpart gw latter would produce dramatic constraint speed gravity gravitational lorentz violation

It follows the formation of a Milky Way-sized halo with Mhalo = 1.8 × 1012 M☉ in a WMAP three-year cosmology, using 234 million particles. Over 10,000 subhalos can be identified at z = 0: their cumulative mass function is well-fit by N(> Msub) = 0.0064 (Msub/Mhalo)-1 down to Msub = 4 × 106 M☉. The total mass fraction in subhalos is 5.3%, while the fraction of surface mass density in substructure within a projected distance of 10 kpc from the halo center is 0.3%. Because of the significant contribution from the smallest resolved subhalos, these fractions have not converged yet. Sub-substructure is apparent in all the larger satellites, and a few dark matter lumps are resolved even in the solar vicinity. The number of dark satellites with peak circular velocities above 10 km s-1 (5 km s-1) is 124 (812): of these, five (26) are found within 0.1rvir, a region that appeared practically smooth in previous simulations. The neutralino self-annihilation γ-ray emission from dark matter clumps is approximately constant per subhalo mass decade. Therefore, while in our run the contribution of substructure to the γ-ray luminosity of the Galactic halo amounts to only 40% of the total spherically averaged smooth signal, we expect this fraction to grow significantly as resolution is increased further. An all-sky map of the expected annihilation γ-ray flux reaching a fiducial observer at 8 kpc from the Galactic center shows that at the current resolution a small number of subhalos start to be bright enough to be visible against the background from the smooth density field surrounding the observer.",Physics,2,0,present initial result via lactea highest resolution simulation date galactic cdm substructure follows formation milky waysized halo mhalo wmap threeyear cosmology using million particle subhalos identified z cumulative mass function wellfit n msub msubmhalo msub total mass fraction subhalos fraction surface mass density substructure within projected distance kpc halo center significant contribution smallest resolved subhalos fraction converged yet subsubstructure apparent larger satellite dark matter lump resolved even solar vicinity number dark satellite peak circular velocity km km five found within rvir region appeared practically smooth previous simulation neutralino selfannihilation γray emission dark matter clump approximately constant per subhalo mass decade therefore run contribution substructure γray luminosity galactic halo amount total spherically averaged smooth signal expect fraction grow significantly resolution increased allsky map expected annihilation γray flux reaching fiducial observer kpc galactic center show current resolution small number subhalos start bright enough visible background smooth density field surrounding observer

Since this scenario depends on the presence of a bounce, it seems appropriate to consider it in the context of loop quantum cosmology where a bouncing universe naturally arises. For a pressureless collapsing universe in loop quantum cosmology, the predicted power spectrum of the scalar perturbations after the bounce is scale-invariant and the tensor to scalar ratio is negligibly small. A slight red tilt can be given to the scale-invariance of the scalar perturbations by a scalar field whose equation of state is P = −ρ, where is a small positive number. Then, the power spectrum for tensor perturbations is also almost scale-invariant with the same red tilt as the scalar perturbations, and the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be r ≈ 9 × 10−4. Finally, for the predicted amplitude of the scalar perturbations to agree with observations, the critical density in loop quantum cosmology must be of the order ρc ~ 10−9ρPl.",Physics,3,0,matter bounce scenario dustdominated contracting spacetime generates scaleinvariant perturbation assuming nonsingular bouncing cosmology propagate expanding branch set appropriate initial condition radiationdominated era since scenario depends presence bounce seems appropriate consider context loop quantum cosmology bouncing universe naturally arises pressureless collapsing universe loop quantum cosmology predicted power spectrum scalar perturbation bounce scaleinvariant tensor scalar ratio negligibly small slight red tilt given scaleinvariance scalar perturbation scalar field whose equation state p ρ small positive number power spectrum tensor perturbation also almost scaleinvariant red tilt scalar perturbation tensor scalar ratio expected r finally predicted amplitude scalar perturbation agree observation critical density loop quantum cosmology must order ρc ρpl

We investigate the nonlinear gravitational clustering of WDM with a high-resolution N-body code and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative to CDM, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low-mass satellites. The number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by ""top-down"" fragmentation of caustics, as part of a ""cosmic web"" connecting massive halos.

The methodological and conceptual bases for the relationship between these phenomenological and interpretative aspects of IPA appear to be underdeveloped in the literature. We, therefore, offer some thoughts on the basis of this relationship, and on its context within qualitative psychology. We discuss the epistemological range of IPA's interpretative focus, and its relationship to the more descriptive features of phenomenological analysis. In order to situate our conclusions within a contextualist position, we draw upon concepts from Heideggerian phenomenology. The argument is illustrated by excerpts from our own research on relationship break-up. We conclude by encouraging IPA researchers to embrace the interpretative opportunities that are offered by this approach.",Psychology,2,0,paper discus two complementary commitment interpretative phenomenological analysis ipa phenomenological requirement understand give voice concern participant interpretative requirement contextualize make sense claim concern psychological perspective methodological conceptual base relationship phenomenological interpretative aspect ipa appear underdeveloped literature therefore offer thought basis relationship context within qualitative psychology discus epistemological range ipas interpretative focus relationship descriptive feature phenomenological analysis order situate conclusion within contextualist position draw upon concept heideggerian phenomenology argument illustrated excerpt research relationship breakup conclude encouraging ipa researcher embrace interpretative opportunity offered approach

I explore these issues phenomenologically by examining five kinds of experiences that counter hope (or in some instances, seem to do so): first, by noting the cases in which hope simply is not operative, then by treating the significance of both desperation and pessimism, next by examining the experience of hopelessness, and finally, by treating the experience of despair. Here despair is shown to constitute the most profound challenge to hope among these experiences and to be foundational for the others, even though it is disclosed ultimately as founded in hope.",Psychology,1,0,abstract paper investigate experience hope focusing experience seem rival hope namely disappointment desperation panic hopelessness despair explore issue phenomenologically examining five kind experience counter hope instance seem first noting case hope simply operative treating significance desperation pessimism next examining experience hopelessness finally treating experience despair despair shown constitute profound challenge hope among experience foundational others even though disclosed ultimately founded hope

It follows through with a thoroughgoing interdisciplinary inquiry into movement from three perspectives: mind, brain, and the conceptually reciprocal realities of receptivity and responsivity as set forth in phenomenology and evolutionary biology, respectively. It ends with a substantive afterword on kinesthesia, pointing up the incontrovertible significance of the faculty to cognition and affectivity.

1695,c53b9df3eedefdd6cba589214d7030c339df6270,Metapragmatic discourse and metapragmatic function,"The aim here is to clarify the nature of what have come to be called in the literature, following Silverstein (1976: 48–51), METAPRAGMATIC phenomena. In particular, the aim is to clarify the distinction between metapragmatic FUNCTIONS of two semiotic types and between such metapragmatic functions and metapragmatic DISCOURSE. Signs functioning metapragmatically have pragmatic phenomena — indexical sign phenomena — as their semiotic objects; they thus have an inherently “framing,” or “regimenting,” or “stipulative” character with respect to indexical phenomena. In this way, as illustrated in the accompanying chapters, the metapragmatic—pragmatic nexus lies at the intersection of specific theoretical concerns with one or another facet of the total linguistic fact. Let me point out some of these concerns. First, there is the line of focus on the language—metalanguage relationship, coming out of the logico-linguistic tradition of analytic philosophy and formal syntax. Here, we assume that there is some language in the usual sense, i.e., some grammatically conforming system of expression-types, tokens of which refer-to some universe of referents and predicate-about some universe of states-of-affairs, and that the objects of reference-and-predication happen to be themselves grammatically conforming expressions of some language, called, by virtue of this, the OBJECT LANGUAGE of metalinguistic usage.

This is a mistake. We should instead understand their phenomenology in terms of their distinctively evaluative intentionality. Emotions are essentially affective modes of response to the ways our circumstances come to matter to us, and so they are ways of being pleased or pained by those circumstances. Making sense of the intentionality and phenomenology of emotions in this way requires rejecting traditional understandings of intentionality and coming to see emotions as a distinctive and irreducible class of mental states lying at the intersection of intentionality, phenomenology, and motivation.",Psychology,2,0,phenomenology emotion traditionally understood term bodily sensation involve mistake instead understand phenomenology term distinctively evaluative intentionality emotion essentially affective mode response way circumstance come matter u way pleased pained circumstance making sense intentionality phenomenology emotion way requires rejecting traditional understanding intentionality coming see emotion distinctive irreducible class mental state lying intersection intentionality phenomenology motivation

In addition, their distribution is discontinuous across genetic and geographic language boundaries, indicating frequent independent invention. Repeated invention of similar figurative expressions is due to universal naming tendencies.

While critics accuse the academy of an obsession with sexuality, they also complain that nothing that appears to refer to sex really does. In readings ranging across film, drama, opera, fine art, and critical theory, Mandy Merck considers these phenomena as well as the role of the dog in anti-porn propaganda, the unacknowledged significance of the lesbian hand, and the early retirement of the phallus. Other topics include the relationship of women's tennis and prostitution, the gendering of the wild and the tame in the age of AIDS, and the sexlessness of postmodern criticism. In Your Face ends with the face and its alleged desecration by fellatio. Germaine Greer's condemnation of Bill Clinton for ""fucking the faces of little girls"" is examined in the light of one of Monica Lewinsky's endearments for the President--""fuckface.""

Certain similarities between the course of \`acute schizophrenia' and the course of manic-depressive psychoses are indicated. From consideration of the available evidence it is suggested that the schizophrenic syndrome is a non-specific clinical entity which can be symptomatic not only of organic cerebral dysfunction but also of manic-depressive psychosis—particularly the manic phase—as well as of schizophrenia itself. It is suggested in consequence that it is the form rather than the psychopathological content of the psychosis which should receive primary consideration in reaching a diagnosis, and revised definitions of schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis embodying this concept are proposed.",Psychology,2,0,traditional division functional psychosis schizophrenic manicdepressive category discussed important difference opinion signified term schizophrenia highlighted certain similarity course acute schizophrenia course manicdepressive psychosis indicated consideration available evidence suggested schizophrenic syndrome nonspecific clinical entity symptomatic organic cerebral dysfunction also manicdepressive psychosisparticularly manic phaseas well schizophrenia suggested consequence form rather psychopathological content psychosis receive primary consideration reaching diagnosis revised definition schizophrenia manicdepressive psychosis embodying concept proposed

berkembang, seperti pet shop/pet store, pet grooming, pet hotel serta pet clinic. 
Pada saat ini industri jasa kesehatan hewan tidak hanya terpaku pada pengobatan 
penyakit,tetapi juga bagaimana memberikan pelayanan yang berkualitas bagi 
konsumennya serta kepercayaan dalam rangka menciptakan kepuasan bagi 
pelanggan sehingga akan terbentuk rasa loyal pada pelanggan. 
Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui dan menganalisa pengaruh 
kualitas pelayanan dan kepercayaan pelanggan terhadap loyalitas pelanggan 
melalui kepuasan pelanggan. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah pelanggan 
Happy Petty Semarang. Jumlah sampel yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini 
sebanyak 100 responden dengan teknik incidental sampling. Metode 
pengumpulan data menggunakan kuesioner. Analisis data menggunakan uji 
instrumen (uji validitas dan uji reliabilitas), analisis deskriptif presentase, uji 
asumsi klasik dan analisis jalur menggunakan SPSS statistik versi 21.

The term ""body image"" has been applied heterogeneously in literature in order to describe a variety of bodily phenomena. In this paper, the German terminology applied to the phenomenology of body experiences is described systematically. In developing a systematic terminology the authors refer to scientific evidence as well as recent reviews, and closely adhere to definitions commonly used in English literature. Different perspectives are utilised, particularly anthropological concepts and theories from developmental and self-psychology. Distinct aspects of body experience are described within the context of a network of external determinants and along a continuum between somatic and mental anchor points. Applying the term ""body experience"" as umbrella term, different aspects are defined: perceptive (body schema/-perceive), affective (body-cathexis), cognitive-evaluative (body-image, body-ego) and body-consciousness.

The studies explore how across various cultures internal body organs such as the heart have been used as the locus of conceptualizing feelings, thinking, knowing, etc. Such conceptualizations appear to be rooted in cultural systems such as ethnomedical and religious traditions. The volume engages with these themes using the analytical tools developed in cognitive linguistics and cognitive anthropology.",Psychology,1,0,volume make significant contribution understanding intricate relationship culture body language focusing conceptualization internal body organ several language study explore across various culture internal body organ heart used locus conceptualizing feeling thinking knowing etc conceptualization appear rooted cultural system ethnomedical religious tradition volume engages theme using analytical tool developed cognitive linguistics cognitive anthropology

They are defined exclusively by their occurrence close to delivery. Attempts to further diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychoses have been prevented to date by the influence of Kraepelin’s dichotomy. New possibilities of nosological differentiation arose out of Kasanin’s (1933) description of schizoaffective psychoses and out of Leonhard’s differentiated nosology (1986). The objective of the present, retrospective study was to apply Leonhard’s nosology to 42 postpartal psychoses. Five diagnostic groups could be identified: 6 cases of manic-depressive disorder, 7 cases of pure depression, 8 cases of pure melancholia, 2 cases of unsystematic schizophrenia, and 19 cases of cycloid psychoses. For this reason we consider that the concept of the cycloid psychoses is appropriate for the characterization of a large proportion of childbed psychoses.",Psychology,3,0,puerperal psychosis traditionally considered nosologically unspecific defined exclusively occurrence close delivery attempt diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychosis prevented date influence kraepelins dichotomy new possibility nosological differentiation arose kasanins description schizoaffective psychosis leonhards differentiated nosology objective present retrospective study apply leonhards nosology postpartal psychosis five diagnostic group could identified case manicdepressive disorder case pure depression case pure melancholia case unsystematic schizophrenia case cycloid psychosis reason consider concept cycloid psychosis appropriate characterization large proportion childbed psychosis

Four main kinds of ritual were found to predominate: cleaning, avoiding, repeating and checking. A surprisingly large number of patients had little or no resistance to carrying out their rituals. The recognition of senselessness of a ritual was a more important criterion than that of resistance, but patients with predominantly repeating rituals did demonstrate resistance. It is proposed that a redefinition of obsessive-compulsive neurosis with less emphasis on resistance as a necessary condition may be appropriate.",Psychology,3,0,summary fortyfive patient obsessivecompulsive neurosis given specially devised structured interview aim elucidating aspect phenomenology four main kind ritual found predominate cleaning avoiding repeating checking surprisingly large number patient little resistance carrying ritual recognition senselessness ritual important criterion resistance patient predominantly repeating ritual demonstrate resistance proposed redefinition obsessivecompulsive neurosis le emphasis resistance necessary condition may appropriate

Arbitration was the most generally preferred means of settlement, followed in order by the moot, mediation, autocratic, and bargaining procedures. The independent variables modified these preferences, however, such that procedures with a high degree of third-party intervention were preferred more when there was temporal urgency, outcome noncorrespondence, and a standard. Interactions revealed that correspondence affected preferences only when there was no temporal urgency, and presence-absence of a standard affected preferences only when there was temporal urgency and outcome correspondence.",Psychology,2,0,experimental study manipulated presence absence temporal urgency presence absence judgmental standard correspondence noncorrespondence outcome among disputant factorial design ass effect preference five disputeresolution procedure arranged along continuum decreasing thirdparty intervention autocratic decisionmaking arbitration moot mediation bargaining arbitration generally preferred mean settlement followed order moot mediation autocratic bargaining procedure independent variable modified preference however procedure high degree thirdparty intervention preferred temporal urgency outcome noncorrespondence standard interaction revealed correspondence affected preference temporal urgency presenceabsence standard affected preference temporal urgency outcome correspondence

The “peculiar temporality” of Angst “holds” Dasein in the presence of its ownmost thrownness, yet in such a way as to hold the moment or Augenblick of possible decision “at the ready” (344). Such being held, the present study will argue, enables the distinctive phenomenon of human athos. For in disclosing Dasein in its “being toward” its ownmost possibility for Being, the temporality of Angst thereby first opens Dasein to the possibility of coming toward itself within and from out of its",Psychology,2,0,throughout marburg freiburg lecture course magnum opus time heidegger never ceased emphasize central importance phenomenon worlda phenomenon claimed never adequately appreciated understood history philosophy indeed seen hannah arendt astutely noted heidegger concept world many respect stand center philosophy time emphasized world referential totality signification enabling disclosure meaning first found possible word language sz phenomenon dasein always already exposed advance dasein could inevitably return whatever degree explicitness also highlighted fundamental attunement angst first discloses world world peculiar temporality angst hold dasein presence ownmost thrownness yet way hold moment augenblick possible decision ready held present study argue enables distinctive phenomenon human athos disclosing dasein toward ownmost possibility temporality angst thereby first open dasein possibility coming toward within

Many philosophers and cognitive scientists now acknowledge the critical importance of situated, environment-involving embodied engagements as a means of understanding basic minds -- including basic forms of human mentality. Yet many of these same theorists hold fast to the view that basic minds are necessarily or essentially contentful -- that they represent conditions the world might be in. In this book, Daniel Hutto and Erik Myin promote the cause of a radically enactive, embodied approach to cognition that holds that some kinds of minds -- basic minds -- are neither best explained by processes involving the manipulation of contents nor inherently contentful. Hutto and Myin oppose the widely endorsed thesis that cognition always and everywhere involves content. They defend the counter-thesis that there can be intentionality and phenomenal experience without content, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach for thinking about scaffolded minds and consciousness",Psychology,3,0,human experience best understood term dynamically unfolding interaction environment many philosopher cognitive scientist acknowledge critical importance situated environmentinvolving embodied engagement mean understanding basic mind including basic form human mentality yet many theorist hold fast view basic mind necessarily essentially contentful represent condition world might book daniel hutto erik myin promote cause radically enactive embodied approach cognition hold kind mind basic mind neither best explained process involving manipulation content inherently contentful hutto myin oppose widely endorsed thesis cognition always everywhere involves content defend counterthesis intentionality phenomenal experience without content demonstrate advantage approach thinking scaffolded mind consciousness

These twins are classified as follows: monozygotic 41 pairs; same-sex dizygotic 53 pairs; opposite-sex dizygotic 48 pairs. There is a marked contrast between monozygotic and dizygotic twins with respect to the proportion of cases of both twins of the pair affected. These proportions are, respectively, 68.3 per cent and 14.9 per cent. In the medical literature of twin pathology great stress has been laid on close similarity or even identicalness of manifestations, particularly in monozygotic twins. However, as regards the so-called schizophrenic psychoses, close similarity or identicalness of manifestations is the exception rather than the rule. Instances of similar psychoses, quantitative dissimilarity (i. e., dissimilarity of age of onset, particular symptomatology, course, outcome, etc.), qualitative dissimilarity (i. e., one twin having a schi...",Psychology,3,0,main object communication report study pair twin socalled schizophrenic psychosis one twin pair twin classified follows monozygotic pair samesex dizygotic pair oppositesex dizygotic pair marked contrast monozygotic dizygotic twin respect proportion case twin pair affected proportion respectively per cent per cent medical literature twin pathology great stress laid close similarity even identicalness manifestation particularly monozygotic twin however regard socalled schizophrenic psychosis close similarity identicalness manifestation exception rather rule instance similar psychosis quantitative dissimilarity e dissimilarity age onset particular symptomatology course outcome etc qualitative dissimilarity e one twin schi

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by ""success"" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. ""Statistical significance"" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental ""cuteness"" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.",Psychology,3,0,physical theory typically predict numerical value improvement experimental precision reduces tolerance range hence increase corroborability psychological research improved power statistical design lead prior probability approaching finding significant difference theoretically predicted direction hence corroboration yielded success weak becomes weaker increased precision statistical significance play logical role psychology precisely reverse role physic problem worsened certain unhealthy tendency prevalent among psychologist premium placed experimental cuteness free reliance upon ad hoc explanation avoid refutation

As the English as a lingua franca field of enquiry grows, this article provides needed dialogue, consideration, and reflection over how we conceptualise our subject matter, our roles, and our rhetorical stances. This paper proposes the usefulness of considering the complexity of language, not as something that gets in the way of empiricism or clarity, but as something that makes ELF researchers perfectly positioned to investigate and contribute to wider understandings of language. Complexity theory is drawn upon as a conceptual tool that can be useful in guiding our thinking about the dynamic nature of language, which, in turn, is considered in relation to the reasons why language is complex, namely its roles in relation to practices and contextualisation. Having established our approaches to the complexity of the language in ELF scenarios, we propose implications for ELF researchers' treatment of speakers, language, and ideology.",Psychology,3,0,abstract paper set theoretical approach language guide author research field underrepresented literature english lingua franca field enquiry grows article provides needed dialogue consideration reflection conceptualise subject matter role rhetorical stance paper proposes usefulness considering complexity language something get way empiricism clarity something make elf researcher perfectly positioned investigate contribute wider understanding language complexity theory drawn upon conceptual tool useful guiding thinking dynamic nature language turn considered relation reason language complex namely role relation practice contextualisation established approach complexity language elf scenario propose implication elf researcher treatment speaker language ideology

The central theme of the volume is the symbolic representation of the psychic totality through the concept of the Self, whose traditional historical equivalent is the figure of Christ. Jung demonstrates his thesis by an investigation of the Allegoria Christi, especially the fish symbol, but also of Gnostic and alchemical symbolism, which he treats as phenomena of cultural assimilation. The first four chapters, on the ego, the shadow, and the anima and animus, provide a valuable summation of these key concepts in Jung's system of psychology.",Psychology,3,0,aion originally published german one major work jung later year central theme volume symbolic representation psychic totality concept self whose traditional historical equivalent figure christ jung demonstrates thesis investigation allegoria christi especially fish symbol also gnostic alchemical symbolism treat phenomenon cultural assimilation first four chapter ego shadow anima animus provide valuable summation key concept jung system psychology

In particular, the roles played by the envious party's social comparison with, and ill will against, the better off are emphasised. The ill will component is characterised by the envier's ultimate goal or wish that the envied suffer some harm, and is distinguished from resentment and sense of injustice, which have often been considered part of envy. The reprehensible nature of envy is discussed, and traced back to the analysis of its components. Finally, we explore both points of overlap and distinguishing features between envy and other emotions such as jealousy or emulation, and make a few general remarks, pointing to the necessity of overcoming conceptual looseness in the notion of envy.",Psychology,3,0,work provides analysis basic cognitive component envy particular role played envious party social comparison ill better emphasised ill component characterised enviers ultimate goal wish envied suffer harm distinguished resentment sense injustice often considered part envy reprehensible nature envy discussed traced back analysis component finally explore point overlap distinguishing feature envy emotion jealousy emulation make general remark pointing necessity overcoming conceptual looseness notion envy
