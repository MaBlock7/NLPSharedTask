0,4281880a7dddb8d4b3b6dbc751add17ee2582351,Jean Louis Schefer: screen memories from L'Homme ordinaire du cinéma,"Jean Louis Schefer is one of the less well-known French philosophers of cinema, and yet his seminal work from 1980, L'Homme ordinaire du cinéma, which has gone largely unnoticed in Anglo-American criticism, has been very influential on French film thinking. This paper sets out to frame Schefer's work in a manner that makes more accessible his unconventional manner and analysis of cinema history. Schefer's philosophy of cinema offers a very personal understanding of how the ‘ordinary person’ experiences cinema and, in particular, how individual films have the ability to shape personal interactions with history and culture, forming an ‘inner history’ that has been a part and continues to be a part of twentieth-century existential being, often confronting us with the more difficult moments and events in recent human history.",Art,3,0,jean louis schefer one le wellknown french philosopher cinema yet seminal work lhomme ordinaire du cinéma gone largely unnoticed angloamerican criticism influential french film thinking paper set frame schefers work manner make accessible unconventional manner analysis cinema history schefers philosophy cinema offer personal understanding ordinary person experience cinema particular individual film ability shape personal interaction history culture forming inner history part continues part twentiethcentury existential often confronting u difficult moment event recent human history

It begins with a general discussion of the methods involved in comparative studies of the Bible and the ancient Near East, showing what one can and cannot prove. The chapter discusses Neo-Babylonian imperialism and argues that both the Neo-Assyrian and the Neo-Babylonian Empires exercised considerable influence over Israel and Judah from the eighth century BC onwards. It examines the Akkadian influence on the language and literary style of Isa 40-55. The chapter then focuses on the specific texts in Isa 40-55 that have often been cited as evidence of a Babylonian provenance of Isa 40 55 - the co-called idol fabrication passages.Keywords: Akkadian influence; Babylonian influence; Isaiah 40-55; Judahite tradition; literary style",Art,2,0,chapter investigates frequent claim babylonian setting isa supported close similarity language isa akkadian explicit reference babylon familiarity religion culture begin general discussion method involved comparative study bible ancient near east showing one prove chapter discus neobabylonian imperialism argues neoassyrian neobabylonian empire exercised considerable influence israel judah eighth century bc onwards examines akkadian influence language literary style isa chapter focus specific text isa often cited evidence babylonian provenance isa cocalled idol fabrication passageskeywords akkadian influence babylonian influence isaiah judahite tradition literary style

Paul Getty Museum, dated 1692, is an outstanding example ofthe estofado technique of imitating brocade in gold leaf and paint. The life-size figure retains most of its original polychromy. In previous restoration treatments, there had been an unsuccessful attempt to simulate the estofado. The present treatment included a comprehensive technical examination, using X-radiography to identify construction techniques and cross-sectional analysis for the layer structure and materials. The decoration of the sculpture was carefully studied with the goal of understanding more clearly the technique of the estofador. A cleaning strategy was then devised. Where there were losses in the estofado, it was decided to aim for a chromatic compensation using watercolours, rather than attempting to duplicate the original process.",Art,4,0,sculpture st gines de la jara collection j paul getty museum dated outstanding example ofthe estofado technique imitating brocade gold leaf paint lifesize figure retains original polychromy previous restoration treatment unsuccessful attempt simulate estofado present treatment included comprehensive technical examination using xradiography identify construction technique crosssectional analysis layer structure material decoration sculpture carefully studied goal understanding clearly technique estofador cleaning strategy devised loss estofado decided aim chromatic compensation using watercolour rather attempting duplicate original process

This book provides a critical analysis of the cinematic representation of fatness during this timeframe, specifically in contemporary Hollywood cinema, with emphasis on the intersection of gender, race and fatness. The analysis is based on around 50 films released since 2000 and includes examples such as Transformers, Precious, Kung Fu Panda, Paul Blart and Pitch Perfect. Barbara Plotz provides a mapping of the common cinematic tropes of fatness and also shows how commonplace notions of fatness that are part of the current ‘‘obesity epidemic’’ discourse are reflected in these tropes. In this original study Plotz brings critical attention to the politics of fat representation, a topic that has so far received little attention within film and cinema studies.",Art,3,0,last two decade fatness become focus ubiquitous negative rhetoric usa beyond presented cover medicalized war obesity epidemic book provides critical analysis cinematic representation fatness timeframe specifically contemporary hollywood cinema emphasis intersection gender race fatness analysis based around film released since includes example transformer precious kung fu panda paul blart pitch perfect barbara plotz provides mapping common cinematic trope fatness also show commonplace notion fatness part current obesity epidemic discourse reflected trope original study plotz brings critical attention politics fat representation topic far received little attention within film cinema study

This chapter affords an in-depth analysis of the film’s form and thematic preoccupations so as to comprehend issues of mobility that are essential to (cinematic) migrant journeys. The author argues that the film’s layered use of on-screen and off-screen mobility reveal the politics of transnational migration and their impact on the migrant’s body. These conventions and their ideological are conveyed to the reader through close readings of select scenes. To further achieve this, the author resorts to the notion of ‘border syndrome’, coined by Gazmend Kapllani in his Short Border Handbook and to Hamid Naficy’s meditations on border subjects in his Accented Cinema, and argues that Hostage reimagines the migrant as a tragic outsider, prone to victimhood.",Art,2,0,giannariss film provides original evocation border crossing reimagining hijacking intercity bus greece clandestine albanian migrant endured police brutality greece chapter affords indepth analysis film form thematic preoccupation comprehend issue mobility essential cinematic migrant journey author argues film layered use onscreen offscreen mobility reveal politics transnational migration impact migrant body convention ideological conveyed reader close reading select scene achieve author resort notion border syndrome coined gazmend kapllani short border handbook hamid naficys meditation border subject accented cinema argues hostage reimagines migrant tragic outsider prone victimhood

This is a guide to the maddeningly enigmatic concept which is supposed to define the human cultural condition at the end of the 20th century. Postmodernism claims that ""modernity"" has collapsed, that the historical process which began with the enlightenment, industrialism, Darwin, Marx, Freud and so on has exhausted itself and there is no more ""future"", just an endlessly ""contemporary"" world full of endlessly contested meanings. This uncertainty has led to a postmodern culture which embodies parody, pastiche and cultural cross-over and claims as its own such diverse phenomena as Andy Warhol, neo-classical architecture and Mickey Mouse!

28,513e5edb347a140dce59112b1bcce22b225f4d42,"The Objective Eye: Color, Form, and Reality in the Theory of Art","This, in a nutshell, is the central problem in the theory of art. It has fascinated philosophers from Plato to Wittgenstein. And it fascinates artists and art historians, who have always drawn extensively on philosophical ideas about language and representation, and on ideas about vision and the visible world that have deep philosophical roots. John Hyman's ""The Objective Eye"" is a radical treatment of this problem, deeply informed by the history of philosophy and science, but entirely fresh. The questions tackled here are fundamental ones: Is our experience of color an illusion? How does the metaphysical status of colors differ from that of shapes? With great agility, Hyman considers what is different between a picture and a written text - and whether absolutely anything can be represented in a picture. For example, can a picture represent a thought or a feeling, or a sound or a smell, or must the things it represents have shapes and colors? Why are some pictures said to be more realistic than others? Is it because they are especially truthful or, on the contrary, because they deceive the eye? ""The Objective Eye"" explores the fundamental concepts we use constantly in our most innocent thoughts and conversations about art, as well as in the most sophisticated art theory. The book progresses from pure philosophy to applied philosophy and ranges from the metaphysics of color to Renaissance perspective, from anatomy in ancient Greece to impressionism in nineteenth-century France. Philosophers, art historians, and students of the arts will find ""The Objective Eye"" challenging and absorbing.",Art,2,0,nutshell central problem theory art fascinated philosopher plato wittgenstein fascinates artist art historian always drawn extensively philosophical idea language representation idea vision visible world deep philosophical root john hymans objective eye radical treatment problem deeply informed history philosophy science entirely fresh question tackled fundamental one experience color illusion metaphysical status color differ shape great agility hyman considers different picture written text whether absolutely anything represented picture example picture represent thought feeling sound smell must thing represents shape color picture said realistic others especially truthful contrary deceive eye objective eye explores fundamental concept use constantly innocent thought conversation art well sophisticated art theory book progress pure philosophy applied philosophy range metaphysics color renaissance perspective anatomy ancient greece impressionism nineteenthcentury france philosopher art historian student art find objective eye challenging absorbing

The modes and forms of a cinema of attractions, which form what is here referred to as the practice of documentary display, did not disappear with the ascendency of Griersonian documentary; instead such approaches continued to inform avant-garde film. This paper examines the connections between nonfiction documentations and avant-garde film- and the resultant implications of this meeting for documentary film theory- through an analysis of the film and critical writings of Jean Painleve (1902-1989). Painleve, whom, according to Bazin, 'occupies a singular and privileged place in French cinema', informed his understandings of documentary through contact with, among others, Bunuel, Man Ray, Bataille, Eisenstein, and Grierson. The analysis of Painleve's surrealist documentary display and his extensive body of critical literature on documentary foregrounds overlooked documentary works and constructs, or resurrects, ignored perspectives on documentary film as a way of extending and revising documentary film theory and the documentary canon.",Art,1,0,griersons theory documentary film socalled cinema attraction relegated position lower form contrast description documentary form civic pedagogy mode form cinema attraction form referred practice documentary display disappear ascendency griersonian documentary instead approach continued inform avantgarde film paper examines connection nonfiction documentation avantgarde film resultant implication meeting documentary film theory analysis film critical writing jean painleve painleve according bazin occupies singular privileged place french cinema informed understanding documentary contact among others bunuel man ray bataille eisenstein grierson analysis painleves surrealist documentary display extensive body critical literature documentary foreground overlooked documentary work construct resurrects ignored perspective documentary film way extending revising documentary film theory documentary canon

With three key texts from the 1970s at the center of her discussion-Marcia K. Lieberman's ""Some Day My Prince Will Come,"" Bruno Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment, and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic-Joosen connects the critical views expressed in these feminist and psychoanalytic interpretations with fictional fairy-tale retellings and illustrations that have been published in Dutch, English, and German since the 1970s. While readers may not automatically connect fairy-tale retellings and criticism, Joosen argues that they represent a similar conviction to understand, interpret, criticize, and experiment with the original tale. Moving through her three critical focus texts in chronological order, Joosen addresses fairy-tale retellings in prose, poetry, and pictures, including revisions of ""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast.""

41,a80093c2637309cc6b492326cd16c242b5f22648,Horse-Racing Fraud in Victorian Fiction,"Curzon reflects that frauds in the late nineteenth century are more subtle and less violent than in the past, when a horse might be “ ‘nobbled’ or ‘got at’ by some person hired for the purpose, or it might be lamed by the farrier, or perhaps poisoned by a stable attendant” (272). In contrast, the “coups” of his own time are planned over months or years, as when bookmakers purchase horses in order to manipulate their odds across multiple races. Such scams may be impossible to detect, much less punish. He concludes that “turf frauds of many kinds, but especially those kinds which entail no penal consequences, are plentiful enough even at the present time” (300). Victorian and contemporary historians have established the changing nature of racing fraud, which became more businesslike as the sport became more commercialized.3 Victorian horse-racing fiction represents a distinctive subculture at the intersection of athletic competition and local and global economies of betting. J. Jeffrey Franklin analyzes gambling as “part of the Victorian discourse of money, [treated] as one among the other channels through which capital was circulated in nineteenth-century Britain” (34–35). I argue further that a focus on horse racing, and on fraud in particular, in Victorian fiction contributes not only to the histories of racing and gambling but also to the history of finance and financial fiction. Writers of fiction were particularly drawn to those earlier forms of fraud mentioned by Curzon, such as poisoning and laming, which could only be carried out by someone intimate enough with the horse to get close and do harm. Such acts of sabotage were motivated by vengeance—usually against the owners of the horse. The elements of class conflict and personal vendetta played into the overall themes of Victorian fiction. The problem of how to identify the perpetrator was consistent with that of other financially themed novels.

Jahrhundert: Ein anonymer Kommentar zum Pariser Verurteilungsdekret von 1277 aus dem Umfeld des Johannes de Nova Domo. Studie und Text,"On March 7, 1277, Etienne Tempier, Bishop of Paris, condemned a list of 219 theological and philosophical theses. This condemnation had a lasting impact on the teaching of philosophy and theology at the late-medieval universities, and many philosophical and theological texts of this time contain references to the “Parisian articles.” In the fifteenth century, probably in Paris between 1418 and 1454, an anonymous commentary on this well-known document was written, which is presented here for the first time. A quotation in the treatise De universali reali by Jean de Maisonneuve (Johannes de Nova Domo) allowed tracing this text back to the circle of this Parisian master. Apart from the first critical edition of the commentary on the basis of all seven known manuscripts, the volume also contains a comprehensive analysis of the text. The detailed discussion of philosophical and theological problems such as God’s absolute and ordained power ( potentia Dei absoluta et ordinata ) is accompanied by a historical analysis of the validity of the condemnation. The volume is completed by an appendix, which contains further texts, as well as indexes of authorities and names. Am 7. Marz 1277 verurteilte der Pariser Bischof Stephan Tempier 219 philosophische und theologische Thesen. Diese Verurteilung hatte einen lang andauernden Einfluss auf die philosophische und theologische Lehrtatigkeit an den spatmittelalterlichen Universitaten, und viele philosophische und theologische Texte dieser Zeit enthalten Hinweise auf die »Pariser Artikel«. Zu diesem wohlbekannten Verurteilungsdekret entstand im 15. Jahrhundert, vermutlich in Paris zwischen 1418 und 1454, ein anonym uberlieferter Kommentar, der hier erstmalig vorgestellt wird.

What happened to the artistic and social practices already thriving in the communities that the missionaries encountered is the story told by art historian and Jesuit specialist Gauvin Alexander Bailey. The Jesuits, determined to convert both spiritually and culturally, put great effort into imparting their own artistic techniques and knowledge. At the same time they were unusually tolerant of the non-European cultures, making artistic accommodations in order to communicate with each particular society. The resulting hybridization was complex: German, Italian, and Flemish as well as the dominant Spanish and Portuguese idioms mingled with multiple Asian and Amerindian traditions. Bailey argues that this cross-pollination of early modern art became the first truly global visual currency for cultural exchange. Through a sweeping look at Japan, China, Mughul India, and Paraguay, the author focuses on four of the most flourishing artistic encounters and discovers much unrecognized or misunderstood art. He overturns the simple thesis that art was imposed on subject cultures in favour of the more difficult paradigm of exchange.

By drawing attention to the film’s depiction of cannibalism, rape and real animal slaughter, the chapter highlights the similarities it shares with other extreme texts, repositioning it within the boarder extreme art film tradition outlined throughout the book. To find out whether this reputation impacts the commercial identity of the film, the chapter moves on to explore the paratextuality of the film. Ultimately concluding that the film’s distributors (Artificial Eye) offer a hybridised object that flirts with extremity, the chapter then examines Ruggero Deodato’s Cannibal Holocaust. Noting similarities between the films, the chapter provides a detailed analysis of Shameless Screen Entertainment collectors’ edition DVD. Showing how the paratextual material re-constructs the film’s history, the analysis argues that Cannibal Holocaust’s remediation moves it away from an exploitation film ghetto by employing traditionally highbrow marketing techniques. By complicating existing ideas regarding the commercial function of extremity, the chapter illustrates the extent to which home entertainment objects obscure long-standing taste distinctions.",Art,3,0,chapter start assessment jeanluc godard auteur status focusing weekend film frequently overlooked discussion extreme art cinema drawing attention film depiction cannibalism rape real animal slaughter chapter highlight similarity share extreme text repositioning within boarder extreme art film tradition outlined throughout book find whether reputation impact commercial identity film chapter move explore paratextuality film ultimately concluding film distributor artificial eye offer hybridised object flirt extremity chapter examines ruggero deodatos cannibal holocaust noting similarity film chapter provides detailed analysis shameless screen entertainment collector edition dvd showing paratextual material reconstructs film history analysis argues cannibal holocaust remediation move away exploitation film ghetto employing traditionally highbrow marketing technique complicating existing idea regarding commercial function extremity chapter illustrates extent home entertainment object obscure longstanding taste distinction

But games also offer markedly different experiences, especially in the realm of interactivity. And what happens in the interface between cinema and games console or PC? Is there a merging of languages as games influence movies and movies influence games? Are some films becoming increasingly like games, and to what extent do they draw on the characteristics of Hollywood or other forms of cinema? ScreenPlay: cinema/videogames/interfaces investigates all these issues and explores the extent to which the tools of film analysis can be applied to games, in particular how the pleasures (and frustrations) of computer games can be compared with those of cinema.",Art,3,0,relationship cinema videogames hollywood film franchise routinely translated game game title make move onto big screen none prominently lara croft iconic star tomb raider series game often depend recognised film genre milieu device branding marketing aspire filmlike quality graphic action game also offer markedly different experience especially realm interactivity happens interface cinema game console pc merging language game influence movie movie influence game film becoming increasingly like game extent draw characteristic hollywood form cinema screenplay cinemavideogamesinterfaces investigates issue explores extent tool film analysis applied game particular pleasure frustration computer game compared cinema
70,7fcb08e5374e706b794226eecb96d3114f5535a9,Surrealism and the Cinema,"It seems it is no longer fashionable to discuss surrealism. Evidently the novelty has worn off. A movement which once provoked irate incomprehension now is the occasion for conveniently trite critical judgements, which most of us are content to reiterate. Alarm has given place to patronizing indulgence—we have persistently refused to face up to the implications of the problems surrealism raises. Of course, it is much safer to accord surrealism some undefined degree of significance, to adopt a compromising position, than it is either to con demn it out of hand or to examine it closely. And so a critic like Marc Soriano, writing on "" Le Surrealisme au cinema "" in Formes et couleurs in 1946, feels entitled to make a statement like "" The quality of the surrealist films is beyond doubt,"" without feeling under any obligation to define this quality. It would appear that, when dealing with a group who deny the claims of logic, it is quite in order to continue with an illogical assertion, unsupported either by explanation or by evidence: "" One may simply note that the words ' cinema' and ' surrealism' are contradictory."" In the light of such a remark, we are left wondering what connection there can possibly be between surrealism and the cinema. If we are to hope to make any progress, we must start at the very beginning, seeking to establish what points of contact may exist between the aims of surrealism and what the cinema has to offer.",Art,3,0,seems longer fashionable discus surrealism evidently novelty worn movement provoked irate incomprehension occasion conveniently trite critical judgement u content reiterate alarm given place patronizing indulgencewe persistently refused face implication problem surrealism raise course much safer accord surrealism undefined degree significance adopt compromising position either con demn hand examine closely critic like marc soriano writing le surrealisme au cinema formes et couleurs feel entitled make statement like quality surrealist film beyond doubt without feeling obligation define quality would appear dealing group deny claim logic quite order continue illogical assertion unsupported either explanation evidence one may simply note word cinema surrealism contradictory light remark left wondering connection possibly surrealism cinema hope make progress must start beginning seeking establish point contact may exist aim surrealism cinema offer

The Hollywood happy ending has long been considered among the most famous and standardised features in the whole of narrative filmmaking. Yet this overused concept is under-analysed in discussions of popular cinema. What exactly is the happy ending? Is it simply a cliche, as commonly supposed? Why has it earned such an unenviable reputation? What does it, or can it, mean? Concentrating especially on conclusions featuring an ultimate romantic union - the final couple - this wide-ranging investigation probes traditional associations between the 'happy ending' and homogeneity, closure,'unrealism', and ideological conservatism, testing widespread assumptions against the evidence offered by a range of classical and contemporary films. It defines key features of the Hollywood happy ending through detailed textual analysis and theoretical debate. It traces the historical development of the scholarly approaches taken towards the cinematic happy ending. It reassesses the concept of cinematic closure and its relationship to genre, ideology and 'unrealism'.",Art,2,0,critical study happy ending classical contemporary hollywood cinema hollywood happy ending long considered among famous standardised feature whole narrative filmmaking yet overused concept underanalysed discussion popular cinema exactly happy ending simply cliche commonly supposed earned unenviable reputation mean concentrating especially conclusion featuring ultimate romantic union final couple wideranging investigation probe traditional association happy ending homogeneity closureunrealism ideological conservatism testing widespread assumption evidence offered range classical contemporary film defines key feature hollywood happy ending detailed textual analysis theoretical debate trace historical development scholarly approach taken towards cinematic happy ending reassesses concept cinematic closure relationship genre ideology unrealism

Instead, it contends that Hollywood departs in important ways from the models of both the restorative nostalgia established by the heritage cinema and Great Britain and the reflective nostalgia commonly found in American literature. Using a wide range of examples from American cinema, American literature, and American culture, it considers the reasons why nostalgia occupies a different place and seeks different kinds of expressions in American culture than it does in other national cultures, examines the leading Hollywood genres in which restorative nostalgia appears and the distinctive ways those genres inflect it, and concludes by urging a closer analysis of the more complex, multi-laminated nostalgia Hollywood films offer as an alternative to Boym’s highly influential categorical dichotomy.",Art,3,0,essay argues complexity nostalgic impulse hollywood cinema inadequately described svetlana boyms particular description hollywood inducing nostalgia offering tranquilizer highly influential general distinction restorative reflective nostalgia instead contends hollywood departs important way model restorative nostalgia established heritage cinema great britain reflective nostalgia commonly found american literature using wide range example american cinema american literature american culture considers reason nostalgia occupies different place seek different kind expression american culture national culture examines leading hollywood genre restorative nostalgia appears distinctive way genre inflect concludes urging closer analysis complex multilaminated nostalgia hollywood film offer alternative boyms highly influential categorical dichotomy

We examined the following features: colour of the wood, occurrence of sapwood, heartwood and discoloured wood, presence of pith, bark and included bark, orientation of grain, texture, homogeneity, occurrence of tension wood, juvenile wood and reaction zones. We concluded that the main part of the original version of the sculpture was made of one larger piece of lime wood (Tilia sp.). The wood was taken from a tree where the stem divides into larger branches. The artist used the natural branching to make the upper part of the statue, one branch for St. Mary and one for Jesus. He also took advantage of the natural eccentricity of the stem. We found out that the original version of the statue was later put apart by sawing so that it could be dressed in textile.

But the confusion surrounding the authorship of the St. Sebastian is a measure of the inadequacy of our knowledge of the brothers’ work, for when Pesci first discovered that it was carved by Gioseppe he still believed that there was only one Giorgetti, and attempted to transfer the whole of Antonio's oeuvre to Gioseppe,2 while many eminent art historians, not to mention most guides in the church, continue to repeat the by now traditional attribution to Antonio.

92,371771656f732bd8c10c54b63f43160932d16257,Echolalias: On the Forgetting of Language,"Just as speech can be acquired, so can it be lost. Speakers can forget words, phrases, even entire languages they once knew; over the course of time peoples, too, let go of the tongues that were once theirs, as languages disappear and give way to the others that follow them. In Echolalias, Daniel Heller-Roazen reflects on the many forms of linguistic forgetfulness, offering a far-reaching philosophical investigation into the persistence and disappearance of speech. In twenty-one brief chapters, he moves among classical, medieval, and modern culture, exploring the interrelations of speech, writing, memory, and oblivion. Drawing his examples from literature, philosophy, linguistics, theology, and psychoanalysis, Heller-Roazen examines the points at which the transience of speech has become a question in the arts, disciplines, and sciences in which language plays a prominent role. Whether the subject is Ovid, Dante, or modern fiction, classical Arabic literature or the birth of the French language, structuralist linguistics or Freud's writings on aphasia, Heller-Roazen considers with clarity, precision, and insight the forms, the effects, and the ultimate consequences of the forgetting of language. In speech, he argues, destruction and construction often prove inseparable. Among peoples, the disappearance of one language can mark the emergence of another; among individuals, the experience of the passing of speech can lie at the origin of literary, philosophical, and artistic creation. From the infant's prattle to the legacy of Babel, from the holy tongues of Judaism and Islam to the concept of the dead language and the political significance of exiled and endangered languages today, Echolalias traces an elegant, erudite, and original philosophical itinerary, inviting us to reflect in a new way on the nature of the speaking animal who forgets.",Art,3,0,speech acquired lost speaker forget word phrase even entire language knew course time people let go tongue language disappear give way others follow echolalia daniel hellerroazen reflects many form linguistic forgetfulness offering farreaching philosophical investigation persistence disappearance speech twentyone brief chapter move among classical medieval modern culture exploring interrelation speech writing memory oblivion drawing example literature philosophy linguistics theology psychoanalysis hellerroazen examines point transience speech become question art discipline science language play prominent role whether subject ovid dante modern fiction classical arabic literature birth french language structuralist linguistics freud writing aphasia hellerroazen considers clarity precision insight form effect ultimate consequence forgetting language speech argues destruction construction often prove inseparable among people disappearance one language mark emergence another among individual experience passing speech lie origin literary philosophical artistic creation infant prattle legacy babel holy tongue judaism islam concept dead language political significance exiled endangered language today echolalia trace elegant erudite original philosophical itinerary inviting u reflect new way nature speaking animal forgets

Despite his accomplishments, Morrissey’s unseemly life and his untimely death in 1878 led revisionists and reformers to erase his important role in early American sport. Nicholson’s biography is a lively account of a unique nineteenth-century Irish-American life. It will be of interest to a wide range of readers interested in topics such as the culture of antebellum New York, the history of Saratoga, and the revival of American horse racing after the Civil War. Nicholson’s claims for Morrissey’s importance are difficult to evaluate, however, because he does not engage with the wider body of scholarship on the nineteenth-century transformation of sport. In particular, the argument that the Saratoga regattas marked “the birth of intercollegiate sports on the modern scale” (in the words of journalist Edward Hotaling, quoted approvingly by Nicholson) cannot be sustained without reference to this literature (124).

Rather than marking the limits of reason or laying foundations for playful skepticism, paradoxes were explicitly sought, carefully elaborated and seriously inquired into, scientifically and philosophically. This entry will string together the most crucial of these paradoxes, one often leading to the other: Tycho demonstrated that the heavens are changing; Kepler showed that vision is a causal process with no inherent cognitive value; Descartes concluded that the passions are the conduits of knowledge; and Bernard Mandeville, already a proud disciple of a self-confident Newtonian science, argued that public virtue arises for private vice.

125,1bd6c3f47958cb91603dc3bd1c127f26af774c2c,A history of bel canto,"Bel canto singing was a historical phenomenon which embraced Italian opera of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It required infinite variety of sound, in particular a lyrical ecstacy, a faultless technique to dispatch the vocal pyrotechnics demanded of it, and earned itself eloquent praise as 'the singing which is heard within the soul'. Rodolfo Celletti, who has devoted his whole career to studying the voice from every historical, technical, and musical aspect, offers here a fascinating history of bel canto singing and the voice in operatic literature. He begins by discussing the links of bel canto with the operatic ideals of the baroque, and points out that the style was created as much by operatic composers and their librettists as by their executants, the singers. To this end he undertakes a review of Italian opera of the period, andtraces the development of the style in different composers and their works. There is a chapetr on Castrati - the voice par excellence of bel canto - and the art of singing in their day. The final chapter looks at the history of bel canto since Rossini, charting its death and resurrection.",Art,3,0,bel canto singing historical phenomenon embraced italian opera eighteenth nineteenth century required infinite variety sound particular lyrical ecstacy faultless technique dispatch vocal pyrotechnic demanded earned eloquent praise singing heard within soul rodolfo celletti devoted whole career studying voice every historical technical musical aspect offer fascinating history bel canto singing voice operatic literature begin discussing link bel canto operatic ideal baroque point style created much operatic composer librettist executant singer end undertakes review italian opera period andtraces development style different composer work chapetr castrato voice par excellence bel canto art singing day final chapter look history bel canto since rossini charting death resurrection

In this challenging collection of fifteen essays, most of which originally appeared in October, she explores the ways in which the break in style that produced postmodernism has forced a change in our various understandings of twentieth-century art, beginning with the almost mythic idea of the avant-garde. Krauss uses the analytical tools of semiology, structuralism, and poststructuralism to reveal new meanings in the visual arts and to critique the way other prominent practitioners of art and literary history write about art. In two sections, ""Modernist Myths"" and ""Toward Postmodernism,"" her essays range from the problem of the grid in painting and the unity of Giacometti's sculpture to the works of Jackson Pollock, Sol Lewitt, and Richard Serra, and observations about major trends in contemporary literary criticism.",Art,4,0,cofounder coeditor october magazine veteran artforum early rosalind krauss presided shared major formulation theory postmodernism challenging collection fifteen essay originally appeared october explores way break style produced postmodernism forced change various understanding twentiethcentury art beginning almost mythic idea avantgarde krauss us analytical tool semiology structuralism poststructuralism reveal new meaning visual art critique way prominent practitioner art literary history write art two section modernist myth toward postmodernism essay range problem grid painting unity giacometti sculpture work jackson pollock sol lewitt richard serra observation major trend contemporary literary criticism

I draw particularly on José Antonio Maravall to advance a schema of recurring Baroque characteristics – fictionalising, hyperbole, melancholy, kitsch and plateauing. Some concepts will seem unfamiliar to scholars used to considering the Baroque as primarily concerned with music, painting or sculpture, or inextricably connected with the Counter-Reformation. These concepts are concerned less with the surface characteristics of the period’s culture and more with underlying ideological trends. I also ask how we can speak of the ‘English’ Baroque, since it has long seemed an alien concept to the residual tradition of English literary and cultural history.",Art,1,0,chapter survey current theory baroque distinguishing see historically view recurring stylistic quirk draw particularly josé antonio maravall advance schema recurring baroque characteristic fictionalising hyperbole melancholy kitsch plateauing concept seem unfamiliar scholar used considering baroque primarily concerned music painting sculpture inextricably connected counterreformation concept concerned le surface characteristic period culture underlying ideological trend also ask speak english baroque since long seemed alien concept residual tradition english literary cultural history

Aims of this analysis are to tease out some ideological and aesthetic tensions that could appear to point, on the one hand, to some formal and thematic continuity between pre-World War II output and that of later years; and, on the other, to the particular role played by technology in shaping a specific formalistic vocabulary in these films.",Art,3,0,abstract essay examines three exemplar case italian industrial cinema genre experienced particular extended apogee decade italy economic boom michelangelo antonionis sette canne un vestito ermanno olmis costruzioni meccaniche riva vittorio de seta franco dodis gela pozzi mare aim analysis tease ideological aesthetic tension could appear point one hand formal thematic continuity preworld war ii output later year particular role played technology shaping specific formalistic vocabulary film

It reappraises the range of effects it is possible to create through the use of graphic devices and explores why literary criticism has dismissed such features as either unreadable experimental gimmicks or, more recently, as examples of the worst kind of postmodern decadence. Through the examination of problematical texts which utilize the graphic surface in innovative and unusual ways, including Samuel Beckett’s Watt, B.S. Johnson’s Albert Angelo, Christine Brooke-Rose’s Thru and Alasdair Gray’s Lanark, this book demonstrates that an awareness of the graphic surface can make significant contributions to interpretation.",Art,2,0,book critically engages visual appearance prose fiction manipulated author alteration typography deconstruction physical form book reappraises range effect possible create use graphic device explores literary criticism dismissed feature either unreadable experimental gimmick recently example worst kind postmodern decadence examination problematical text utilize graphic surface innovative unusual way including samuel beckett watt b johnson albert angelo christine brookeroses thru alasdair gray lanark book demonstrates awareness graphic surface make significant contribution interpretation

141,4131f18df0da0f5d6dd2455692b85496ec4e96a4,What lies beneath : orthodoxy and the occult in Victorian literature,"This thesis explores the relationship between orthodox Christianity, quasi-religious movements, pseudo-science and the supernatural in both a pre- and post-Darwinian world, tracing it through fiction and non-fiction, and in novels, novellas and short stories by canonical authors Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, by the lesser known writers Catherine Crowe, and Arthur Machen, and in the non-Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. Across this variety of literary forms, these very different authors all engage with the supernatural, with quasi religious creeds and with pseudo-science. Chapter One focuses on the presence of the supernatural and the spirit world in Edward Bulwer Lytton's Zanoni (1846), and The Haunted and the Haunters; or the House and the Brain (1859), Catherine Crowe's The Night-Side of Nature (1848), and Charles Dickens' Christmas stories. Chapter two explores George Eliot's use of superstition and medieval and Jewish mysticism in The Mill on the Floss (1860), and Daniel Deronda (1876), before considering Thomas Hardy's Anglo-centric approach to similar issues in The Return of the Native (1878), and ""The Withered Arm"" (1888). Chapter three discusses the late nineteenth century interest in spiritualism, Egyptology, and ancient religion as represented in Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan (1894) and Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The King of Thoth"" (1890) and ""Lot No. 249"" (1894).

Federico Zignani's expert photography complements his mother's text. Franci begins by reviewing the various phases that Las Vegas has undergone from a city dedicated to gambling to a modern venue of dramatically themed resorts dedicated to mass tourism. She traces the evolution of Las Vegas from its 1940s western phase epitomized by El Rancho Vegas and Hotel Last Frontier and the clubs downtown, to the ""sleek supper-club architecture"" of the Flamingo, Desert Inn, and Sands, before addressing the mega-resort trend of recent decades (p. 26). Her book is firmly set in the literature of postmodern architecture and Las Vegas history. Indeed, she moves the field of inquiry popularized by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour in the 1970s, and extended by Alan Hess, Frances Anderton, and John Chase in the 1990s, in a new direction partially inspired by Manfred Pfister's edited work on the ""Italies"" of British travelers.[1]",Art,4,0,giovanna franci offer provocative interpretation la vega appeal colorful work featuring numerous photograph building statue object alongside authentic inspiration italy federico zignanis expert photography complement mother text franci begin reviewing various phase la vega undergone city dedicated gambling modern venue dramatically themed resort dedicated mass tourism trace evolution la vega western phase epitomized el rancho vega hotel last frontier club downtown sleek supperclub architecture flamingo desert inn sand addressing megaresort trend recent decade p book firmly set literature postmodern architecture la vega history indeed move field inquiry popularized robert venturi denise scott brown steven izenour extended alan hess france anderton john chase new direction partially inspired manfred pfisters edited work italy british traveler

They devote a chapter to each of the major Mayan city-states. What makes this volume more accessible and of greater impact than the average scholarly study are the frequent vignettes of great events, kingly acts, etc., told dramatically, in a fictive but plausible style that allows the ancient Maya at last to speak for themselves.

155,1c20f3094f3e26ba669b992ca22dbb0151d319ad,The memory of Tiresias : intertextuality and film,"The concept of intertextuality has proven of inestimable value in recent attempts to understand the nature of literature and its relation to other systems of cultural meaning. In ""The Memory of Tiresias"", Mikhail Iamposlki presents the first sustained attempt to develop a theory of cinematic intertextuality. Building on the insights of semiotics and contemporary film theory, Iampolski defines cinema as a chain of transparent, mimetic fragments intermixed with quotations he calls 'textual anomalies'. These challenge the normalization of meaning and seek to open reading out onto the unlimited field of cultural history, which is understood in texts as a semiotically active extract, already inscribed. Quotations obstruct mimesis and are consequently transformed in the process of semiosis, an operation that Iampolski defines as reading in an aura of enigma. In a series of brilliant analyses of films by D.W. Griffith, Sergei Eisenstein, and Luis Bunuel, he presents different strategies of intertextual reading in their work. His book suggests the continuing centrality of semiotic analysis and is certain to interest film historians and theorists, as well as readers in cultural and literary studies.",Art,4,0,concept intertextuality proven inestimable value recent attempt understand nature literature relation system cultural meaning memory tiresias mikhail iamposlki present first sustained attempt develop theory cinematic intertextuality building insight semiotics contemporary film theory iampolski defines cinema chain transparent mimetic fragment intermixed quotation call textual anomaly challenge normalization meaning seek open reading onto unlimited field cultural history understood text semiotically active extract already inscribed quotation obstruct mimesis consequently transformed process semiosis operation iampolski defines reading aura enigma series brilliant analysis film dw griffith sergei eisenstein luis bunuel present different strategy intertextual reading work book suggests continuing centrality semiotic analysis certain interest film historian theorist well reader cultural literary study

Its effect in sculpture became visible several decades later. This book sheds light on this neglected aspect and leads to a better understanding of the art of the period in general.

Surprisingly, however, this book is the first recent critical study of this fascinating phenomenon. Wiebe focuses on modern visions of Jesus, as described to him by thirty contemporary visionaries - most of them ordinary people without prior or subsequent experiences of this kind. He recounts each of the visions in vivid detail, reviews recent biblical scholarship on the subject, and examines current literature on the psychology and neurology of visual hallucinations. He ultimately concludes that contemporary visions of Jesus represent genuine religious experiences of a mystical character and he calls for further discussion of their philosophical and theological implications.",Art,1,0,vision apparition jesus reported since earliest day christianity widely known event still experienced surprisingly however book first recent critical study fascinating phenomenon wiebe focus modern vision jesus described thirty contemporary visionary ordinary people without prior subsequent experience kind recount vision vivid detail review recent biblical scholarship subject examines current literature psychology neurology visual hallucination ultimately concludes contemporary vision jesus represent genuine religious experience mystical character call discussion philosophical theological implication

And from man's sacrifice and dismemberment came the entire world, including the hierarchical ordering of human society. The Head Beneath the Altar is the first book to present a wide-ranging study of Hindu texts read through the lens of Rene Girard's mimetic theory of the sacrificial origin of religion and culture. For those interested in Girard and comparative religion, the book also performs a careful reading of Girard's work, drawing connections between his thought and the work of theorists like Georges Dumezil and Giorgio Agamben. Brian Collins examines the idea of sacrifice from the earliest recorded rituals through the flowering of classical mythology and the ancient Indian institutions of the duel, the oath, and the secret warrior society. He also uncovers implicit and explicit critiques in the tradition, confirming Girard's intuition that Hinduism offers an alternative anti-sacrificial worldview to the one contained in the gospels.",Art,4,0,beginning say ancient hindu text rg veda man man sacrifice dismemberment came entire world including hierarchical ordering human society head beneath altar first book present wideranging study hindu text read lens rene girard mimetic theory sacrificial origin religion culture interested girard comparative religion book also performs careful reading girard work drawing connection thought work theorist like george dumezil giorgio agamben brian collins examines idea sacrifice earliest recorded ritual flowering classical mythology ancient indian institution duel oath secret warrior society also uncovers implicit explicit critique tradition confirming girard intuition hinduism offer alternative antisacrificial worldview one contained gospel

This supposed accuracy also helped to legitimate Victorian geography's illuminations of the ""darkest"" recesses of the globe with the ""light"" of scientific mapping techniques.But as James R. Ryan argues in ""Picturing Empire,"" Victorian photographs reveal as much about the imaginative landscapes of imperial culture as they do about the ""real"" subjects captured within their frames. Ryan considers the role of photography in the exploration and domestication of foreign landscapes, in imperial warfare, in the survey and classification of ""racial types, "" in ""hunting with the camera, "" and in teaching imperial geography to British schoolchildren.Ryan's careful exposure of the reciprocal relation between photographic image and imperial imagination will interest all those concerned with the cultural history of the British Empire.",Art,1,0,coinciding extraordinary expansion britain overseas empire queen victoria invention photography allowed million see thought realistic unbiased picture distant people place supposed accuracy also helped legitimate victorian geography illumination darkest recess globe light scientific mapping techniquesbut james r ryan argues picturing empire victorian photograph reveal much imaginative landscape imperial culture real subject captured within frame ryan considers role photography exploration domestication foreign landscape imperial warfare survey classification racial type hunting camera teaching imperial geography british schoolchildrenryans careful exposure reciprocal relation photographic image imperial imagination interest concerned cultural history british empire

In contrast to representational and/or mimetic meta-theories of acting, which construct their views of action from a position as an outside observer to the process/phenomenon of acting, an enactive view provides an account of acting from ""inside"" the process itself—that is, from the perspective of the actor as enactor/doer. Acting is not to be viewed as embodying a representation of a role or a character, but rather should be understood as a dynamic, lived experience in which the actor is responsive to the demands of the particular moment within a specific (theatrical) environment.",Art,3,0,drawing recent development phenomenology cognitive science anthropological ecology essay explores enactive approach metatheoretical understanding acting phenomenon contrast representational andor mimetic metatheories acting construct view action position outside observer processphenomenon acting enactive view provides account acting inside process itselfthat perspective actor enactordoer acting viewed embodying representation role character rather understood dynamic lived experience actor responsive demand particular moment within specific theatrical environment

There are ten Augustinian authors of quodlibeta that are known to survive at least in part, all apparently from Paris, eight by Italians.

By exploring the interplay between the two forms, Catherine Russell throws new light on both the avant-garde and visual anthropology.

Russell provides detailed analyses of more than thirty-five films and videos from the 1890s to the 1990s and discusses a wide range of film and videomakers, including Georges Melies, Maya Deren, Peter Kubelka, Ray Birdwhistell, Jean Rouch, Su Friedrich, Bill Viola, Kidlat Tahimik, Margaret Mead, Tracey Moffatt, and Chantal Akerman. Arguing that video enables us to see film differently—not as a vanishing culture but as bodies inscripted in technology, Russell maps the slow fade from modernism to postmodern practices. Combining cultural critique with aesthetic analysis, she explores the dynamics of historical interruption, recovery, and reevaluation. As disciplinary boundaries dissolve, Russell contends, ethnography is a means of renewing the avant-gardism of “experimental” film, of mobilizing its play with language and form for historical ends. “Ethnography” likewise becomes an expansive term in which culture is represented from many different and fragmented perspectives.

Original in both its choice of subject and its theoretical and methodological

approaches, Experimental Ethnography will appeal to visual anthropologists, as well as film scholars interested in experimental and documentary practices.",Art,2,0,experimental film ethnographic film long considered separate autonomous practice margin mainstream cinema exploring interplay two form catherine russell throw new light avantgarde visual anthropology russell provides detailed analysis thirtyfive film video discus wide range film videomakers including george melies maya deren peter kubelka ray birdwhistell jean rouch su friedrich bill viola kidlat tahimik margaret mead tracey moffatt chantal akerman arguing video enables u see film differentlynot vanishing culture body inscripted technology russell map slow fade modernism postmodern practice combining cultural critique aesthetic analysis explores dynamic historical interruption recovery reevaluation disciplinary boundary dissolve russell contends ethnography mean renewing avantgardism experimental film mobilizing play language form historical end ethnography likewise becomes expansive term culture represented many different fragmented perspective original choice subject theoretical methodological approach experimental ethnography appeal visual anthropologist well film scholar interested experimental documentary practice

We analyse two Amondawa time interval systems based on natural environmental events (seasons and days), as well as the Amondawa system for categorising lifespan time (“age”). Amondawa time intervals are exclusively event-based, as opposed to time-based (i.e. they are based on event-duration, rather than measured abstract time units). Amondawa has no lexicalised abstract concept of time and no practices of time reckoning, as conventionally understood in the anthropological literature. Our findings indicate that not only are time interval systems and categories linguistically and culturally specific, but that they do not depend upon a universal “concept of time”. We conclude that the abstract conceptual domain of time is not a human cognitive universal, but a cultural historical construction, semiotically mediated by symbolic and cultural-cognitive artefacts for time reckoning.",Art,3,0,report ethnographic fieldexperimentbased study time interval amondawa tupi language culture amazonia analyse two amondawa time interval system based natural environmental event season day well amondawa system categorising lifespan time age amondawa time interval exclusively eventbased opposed timebased ie based eventduration rather measured abstract time unit amondawa lexicalised abstract concept time practice time reckoning conventionally understood anthropological literature finding indicate time interval system category linguistically culturally specific depend upon universal concept time conclude abstract conceptual domain time human cognitive universal cultural historical construction semiotically mediated symbolic culturalcognitive artefact time reckoning

178,ab6c377ef5c24cdc99ff940c39f7c0a389c74c8f,Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet,"Michelangelo Buonarroti's influence upon baroque sculpture is now widely recognised by historians. Ever since that morning in 1506 when he and the Sangalli, father and son, watched the white Pentelic marble of the Laokoön emerge from the farmland of Felice de Freddis near the Baths of Titus, Michelangelo's restless mind found authority in antiquity for a revision of his aesthetic canons. In this agonising group Michelangelo found justification for moving beyond the symmetry, restraint, and proportione divina of the Donatellian mode of sculpture, the static scientism of Da Vinci's painting, and the Vitruvian rules of architecture—even though he paid lip service to those rules and even recited them to popes. Whereas Michelangelo did not acknowledge this influence in writing, or apparently in speaking, his contorted and anguished Haman (1511–12) on the spandrel of the Sistine Vault was an admission of the influence of this Rhodian group —just as El Greco's newly-restored Laokoön in Washington acknowledges it as the one work of art which initiated European baroque. Moreover, the anguishes of the Vatican Laokoön and the expressions thereof were to parallel those tensions—visible even in his death mask—of Michelangelo's own soul and to leave an imprint upon his poetry. Laokoön, it should be remembered in view of his impact upon European baroque, was a militant, ritualistic priest.",Art,4,0,michelangelo buonarrotis influence upon baroque sculpture widely recognised historian ever since morning sangalli father son watched white pentelic marble laokoön emerge farmland felice de freddis near bath titus michelangelo restless mind found authority antiquity revision aesthetic canon agonising group michelangelo found justification moving beyond symmetry restraint proportione divina donatellian mode sculpture static scientism da vincis painting vitruvian rule architectureeven though paid lip service rule even recited pope whereas michelangelo acknowledge influence writing apparently speaking contorted anguished haman spandrel sistine vault admission influence rhodian group el greco newlyrestored laokoön washington acknowledges one work art initiated european baroque moreover anguish vatican laokoön expression thereof parallel tensionsvisible even death maskof michelangelo soul leave imprint upon poetry laokoön remembered view impact upon european baroque militant ritualistic priest

This artistic form, complex in its formal ambiguity between two and three dimensionality, maintains closer relations with the other arts, painting and architecture than with sculpture in the round. Its place is particularly important during the period covered by the Carnets, when Romanticism appeared and developed in sculpture, and commands for public monumental sculpture, often featuring reliefs, were multiplied. 
Close to the theoretical contributions of the sculptor Griffoul-Dorval, those Quatremere de Quincy as well asof Humbert de Superville, David, however, sustained an original conception. Analyzing Antique bas-relief, he included the analysis of Egyptian art, non-realist and colossal, praised Greek bas-relief in its mastery on the intelligibility of the symbol and rejected Roman art, assimilated with the Baroque spirit whose decadence he globally fustigated. The central idea which emerges from the body of texts constituted by the Carnets is that of the plane, both a technique and a style. The realization of reliefs according to the recommendations of David should provide an inmediate intelligibility and render its status as monumental writing, of ""sacerdotal explanation for the centuries"", which contributes, with the statue itself, in the bringing on of the apotheosis of the person.",Art,3,0,carnets writetn sculptor davud danger bring fundamental theoretical contribution debate relief sculpture artistic form complex formal ambiguity two three dimensionality maintains closer relation art painting architecture sculpture round place particularly important period covered carnets romanticism appeared developed sculpture command public monumental sculpture often featuring relief multiplied close theoretical contribution sculptor griffouldorval quatremere de quincy well asof humbert de superville david however sustained original conception analyzing antique basrelief included analysis egyptian art nonrealist colossal praised greek basrelief mastery intelligibility symbol rejected roman art assimilated baroque spirit whose decadence globally fustigated central idea emerges body text constituted carnets plane technique style realization relief according recommendation david provide inmediate intelligibility render status monumental writing sacerdotal explanation century contributes statue bringing apotheosis person

O arcabouco narrativo do mito perfaz-se em quatro mitemas: a) a participacao de Orfeu na viagem dos Argonautas; b) seu amor pela ninfa Euridice, que logo lhe e arrebatada pela morte; c) sua catabase ao Hades, aonde vai para resgatar a esposa dos mortos: ele o consegue, mas ao olhar para tras infringe a proibicao dos reis infernais e perde Euridice definitivamente; d) a propria morte violenta de Orfeu, dilacerado pelas furiosas bacantes da Tracia. Aos quatro mitemas, soma-se o atributo geral do Vate portador da lira, cujo canto aliciante comovia e demovia animais, pedras e arvores, mas tambem homens e deuses. Orfeu, por isto, seria um heroi civilizador mais afeito a polis (e nao autor de facanhas grandiosas como Heracles ou Teseu), pois ensina pelo poder e pela sabedoria do canto (musica e poesia unidas, fundamentais na educacao grega).O carater civilizador de Orfeu transparece nos quatro mitemas (o primeiro e vincadamente epico; os outros tres sao lirico-dramaticos, conforme a riquissima tradicao artistico-literaria que engendraram). Para o momento, pretende-se apresentar criticamente as tres epopeias Argonauticas legadas pelo mundo antigo: a de Apolonio de Rodes (contexto helenistico; sec. III a.C.), a de Valerio Flaco (contexto imperial romano, de restauracao; sec. I. d. C.) e a considerada anonima (sec. IV d. C.), estudando-as numa perspectiva comparativa que problematize historia e religiao, mito (Orfeu) e sociedade, literatura e filosofia.

ABSTRACT: Orpheus (the most important ancient legendary poet) is one of the most fascinating myths of the Greek pantheon, besides being considered the founder of the cult of mysteries named after him (Orphism). The narrative framework of the myth is made up of four mythemes: a) the participation of Orpheus in the voyage of the Argonauts; b) his love for the nymph Eurydice, who is soon snatched away by death; c) his katabasis to Hades, where he goes to rescue his wife from the dead: he manages to do it, but when he turns to look back at her he violates the prohibition of the infernal kings and loses Eurydice forever; d) Orpheus' own violent death, torn apart by the furious maenads of Thrace. The general attribute of the poet who played the lyre is summed up to the four mythemes; his alluring songs touched and dissuaded animals, rocks and trees, but also men and gods. Orpheus, therefore, would be a civilizing hero more inclined to the polis (and not the author of grand exploits as Heracles or Theseus), as he teaches through the power and the wisdom of the song (music and poetry united, essential in Greek education).The civilizing character of Orpheus is evident in the four mythemes (the first is markedly epic; the other three are lyric-dramatic, according to the rich artistic-literary tradition that they engendered). For the moment, we intend to critically present the three Argonautic epopees bequeathed by the ancient world: the one from Apollonius of Rhodes (Hellenistic context; 3rd century B.C.), the one from Valerius Flaccus (Roman Imperial Restoration context; 1st century A.C.) and the one considered anonymous (4th century A.C.), studying them in a comparative perspective that problematizes history and religion, myth (Orpheus) and society, literature and philosophy.

Indeed, it soon became evident that if meaning with any degree of resonance was to be arrived at, such a technique had to be abandoned in favour of an interpretative analysis in relation to myths and praise songs on the one hand, and the observation of the use of sculpture in ritual on the other. Résumé LES SCULPTURES ET LES MYTHES D'ESHU-ELEGBA, LE FOURBE YORUBA: DÉFINITION ET INTERPRÉTATION DANS L'ICONOGRAPHIE YORUBA Les formes sculptées d'Eshu-Elegba, le fourbe Yoruba ou dieu de l'espièglerie, sont présentées, ainsi que ses rites et certains des mythes et des chansons de louanges renfermant une description de ses caractéristiques et de ses activités. Dans la société Yoruba, le fourbe est employé pour fournir une explication d'une conduite déviatrice; il constitue l'extériorisation des difficultés du conformisme. Il est également l'ennemi de la stagnation. Il a une fonction explicative dans la cosmologie Yoruba, car il témoigne que, bien que les gens soient bien informés par l'oracle Ifa, ses activités trouveront sûrement un chemin et exigeront une mise au point continuelle. Cependant, Eshu-Elegba ne constitue pas l'espièglerie au hasard, ni simplement ‘la colère des dieux’; il est également, sous son aspect positif, associé avec la productivité, le changement et la croissance. Ses symboles sont examinés et leur signification est interprétée au moyen des mythes, des chansons et des rites et aux termes des valeurs et du fonctionnement de la culture. Dans la présentation de sa nature ambiguë, des contradictions inhérentes sont examinées, et dans l'analyse de ses symboles certaines agrégations se dégagent. Il est constaté que la cohérence de ces agrégations s'appuie largement sur le principe de la redondance et que la signification d'un élément constitutif quelconque est rendue claire par rapport aux autres. Une comparaison avec les personnages fourbes dans d'autres cultures est complétée par la présentation du complexe de l'espièglerie comme il est connu aux psychologues analytiques, afin d'indiquer comment ce genre d'analyse interprétative pourrait profiter des méthodes faisant appel à plusieurs disciplines.",Art,3,0,opening paragraph field study yoruba art little symbolic meaning form component element ritual sculpture revealed straightforward answer straightforward question indeed soon became evident meaning degree resonance arrived technique abandoned favour interpretative analysis relation myth praise song one hand observation use sculpture ritual résumé le sculpture et le mythes deshuelegba le fourbe yoruba définition et interprétation dans liconographie yoruba le formes sculptées deshuelegba le fourbe yoruba ou dieu de lespièglerie sont présentées ainsi que s rite et certains de mythes et de chansons de louanges renfermant une description de s caractéristiques et de s activités dans la société yoruba le fourbe est employé pour fournir une explication dune conduite déviatrice il constitue lextériorisation de difficultés du conformisme il est également lennemi de la stagnation il une fonction explicative dans la cosmologie yoruba car il témoigne que bien que le gen soient bien informés par loracle ifa s activités trouveront sûrement un chemin et exigeront une mise au point continuelle cependant eshuelegba ne constitue pa lespièglerie au hasard ni simplement la colère de dieux il est également sou son aspect positif associé avec la productivité le changement et la croissance s symboles sont examinés et leur signification est interprétée au moyen de mythes de chansons et de rite et aux termes de valeurs et du fonctionnement de la culture dans la présentation de sa nature ambiguë de contradiction inhérentes sont examinées et dans lanalyse de s symboles certaines agrégations se dégagent il est constaté que la cohérence de ce agrégations sappuie largement sur le principe de la redondance et que la signification dun élément constitutif quelconque est rendue claire par rapport aux autres une comparaison avec le personnages fourbes dans dautres culture est complétée par la présentation du complexe de lespièglerie comme il est connu aux psychologues analytiques afin dindiquer comment ce genre danalyse interprétative pourrait profiter de méthodes faisant appel à plusieurs discipline

The second is the exploration of making graphic images appear to move, encapsulated in a series of amusement devices, which became known as philosophical or optical toys (Wyver, 1989 and Nowell-Smith, 1997). The Daguerrotype and Niepce images (see Figures 1 and 2) depict the way that the formative history of cinema is usually portrayed.

Avec le passage des longs romans aux nouvelles galantes, la date de 1660 est souvent consideree comme une date charniere pour le genre romanesque. Ce renouveau formel interesse tout particulierement la question de l’affectivite – aussi bien sur les plans stylistique, enonciatif que pragmatique. Alors que l’expression pathetique se voit redefinie par la critique de l’ornement et la promotion du naturel, les vicissitudes du roman semblent en partie correlees a celles de l’art de parler.

How might one engage in a profitable exchange with philological, exegetical and theological approaches to this topic? The author's thoughts on this question are articulated in three interrelated sections. Firstly, the author begins with a few hermeneutical remarks aimed at situating contemporary interest in otherworldly concepts in ancient religions. The second stage offers some methodological observations on comparative analysis. Finally, attention is drawn to the various media one is considering to reconstruct religious images on existential and cosmological dimensions of human life.

On Martin Heidegger's conception of Being as Dwelling and Jern Utzon's Architecture of Well-being,"The German philosopher Martin Heidegger’s seminal essay “Building, Dwelling, Thinking”, published in 1954, is one of the texts which has had most influence on architectural thinking in the second half of 20th and early 21st century. What much of modern and postmodern architectural thinking extracts from Heidegger’s text and revolves around is the understanding of building and dwelling as more or less abstract forms of being without taking into account the people inhabiting space. In these traditions little has been said about what the Danish architect Jørn Utzon adds to the term “being” and announces as the most important aspect of architecture: Well-being understood as human well-being. The present paper means to re-interpret Heidegger’s text critically in order to rethink dwelling and building within an architectural context, presenting Jørn Utzon’s work and thinking as a lifelong search for the architecture of well-being.",Art,3,0,german philosopher martin heidegger seminal essay building dwelling thinking published one text influence architectural thinking second half th early st century much modern postmodern architectural thinking extract heidegger text revolves around understanding building dwelling le abstract form without taking account people inhabiting space tradition little said danish architect jørn utzon add term announces important aspect architecture wellbeing understood human wellbeing present paper mean reinterpret heidegger text critically order rethink dwelling building within architectural context presenting jørn utzons work thinking lifelong search architecture wellbeing

At the heart of his ever-relevant inquiry is the inescapable conflict in the West between marriage and passion--the first associated with social and religious responsiblity and the second with anarchic, unappeasable love as celebrated by the troubadours of medieval Provence. These early poets, according to de Rougemont, spoke the words of an Eros-centered theology, and it was through this ""heresy"" that a European vocabulary of mysticism flourished and that Western literature took on a new direction. Bringing together historical, religious, philosophical, and cultural dimensions, the author traces the evolution of Western romantic love from its literary beginnings as an awe-inspiring secret to its commercialization in the cinema. He seeks to restore the myth of love to its original integrity and concludes with a philosophical perspective on modern marriage.",Art,3,0,classic work often described history rise decline fall love affair denis de rougemont explores psychology love legend tristan isolde hollywood heart everrelevant inquiry inescapable conflict west marriage passionthe first associated social religious responsiblity second anarchic unappeasable love celebrated troubadour medieval provence early poet according de rougemont spoke word eroscentered theology heresy european vocabulary mysticism flourished western literature took new direction bringing together historical religious philosophical cultural dimension author trace evolution western romantic love literary beginning aweinspiring secret commercialization cinema seek restore myth love original integrity concludes philosophical perspective modern marriage

A human according to some, who had lived about the time of Moses, but now indisputably a god, he was credited with the authorship of a whole library of books on magic and the supernatural, alchemy, astrology, theology and philosophy. Starting from the complex fusions and tensions that moulded Graeco-Egyptian culture, and in particular Hermetism, in the centuries after Alexander, Dr Fowden goes on to argue that the technical and philosophical Hermetica, apparently so different, might be seen as aspects of a single 'way of Hermes' that led the initiate from knowledge of the World through knowledge of the Self to knowledge of God. The focus and conclusion of the book is an assault on the problem of the social milieu of Hermetism by looking at the mythological facade of the texts themselves and deploying the numerous allusions to be found in other sources of the period.",Art,4,0,first book sage scientist sorcerer hermes trismegistus culturehero hellenistic roman egypt human according lived time moses indisputably god credited authorship whole library book magic supernatural alchemy astrology theology philosophy starting complex fusion tension moulded graecoegyptian culture particular hermetism century alexander dr fowden go argue technical philosophical hermetica apparently different might seen aspect single way hermes led initiate knowledge world knowledge self knowledge god focus conclusion book assault problem social milieu hermetism looking mythological facade text deploying numerous allusion found source period

Unlike his fellow stars, he despised the commercial films he made, and engaged with the surrealists and their sympathizers, leading to his role as the Man in Un chien andalou in 1929. In this article, we argue that Batcheff's performance style, which more often than not involved distancing himself from the action and from his female screen partners, and his star persona as the exotic other, contributed to make him what might seem like a contradiction in terms: a surrealist star. We show how the ideological preoccupations of the surrealists at the end of the 1920s, whether in relation to literature (Breton), painting (Dalí), or cinema (Artaud), intersected with those of Batcheff, making him an exemplary uncanny object, as defined by Hal Foster's work on surrealism.",Art,4,0,abstract pierre batcheff one foremost jeunes premier cinema unlike fellow star despised commercial film made engaged surrealist sympathizer leading role man un chien andalou article argue batcheffs performance style often involved distancing action female screen partner star persona exotic contributed make might seem like contradiction term surrealist star show ideological preoccupation surrealist end whether relation literature breton painting dalí cinema artaud intersected batcheff making exemplary uncanny object defined hal foster work surrealism

271,fbc4d209e56ef456adb2f61bcff92584d0a9805a,Postmodern poetry in Britain,"If the era of 'postmodernity' is increasingly seen as 'a socio-economic mode that has intensified and surpassed modernity itself' then poetry produced under this new 'socio-economic mode' might rightly be dismissed as another form of 'postmodern' candyfloss neatly packaged for our quick or therapeutic consumption. On the other hand perhaps poets, often relatively uninvested in the capital of a culture industry, which is currently terming itself in its latest guise as 'postmodern', are one of the few cultural producers left who can afford to be sceptical of the current era and of the claims of culture itself. Paradoxically, this means that poetry has the potential to be the most 'postmodern' and the most ' anti -postmodern' of the arts. Anthologies of the period reflect the unease with which contemporary poets and critics have embraced and subsequently distanced themselves from such an elastic term. Although there is some overlap between poets represented in anthologies of British poetry since 1980, what is most striking is the divergence between them that marks an important and decisive split in post-war poetry in Britain. Poets from both groupings have been termed 'postmodern'. There are clearly a number of definitions of the 'postmodern' in operation here. The first is linked to the branding, dilution (under the guise of accessibility) and commodification of intellectual and creative activity which have become key features of the 'postmodern' era. The second relates to the formal and conceptual features of 'postmodernism' as it has developed in relation to other disciplines such as architecture and the visual arts. The editors of The New Poetry (1993) describe their selection as emphasising 'accessibillity, democracy and responsiveness, humour and seriousness'.",Art,4,0,era postmodernity increasingly seen socioeconomic mode intensified surpassed modernity poetry produced new socioeconomic mode might rightly dismissed another form postmodern candyfloss neatly packaged quick therapeutic consumption hand perhaps poet often relatively uninvested capital culture industry currently terming latest guise postmodern one cultural producer left afford sceptical current era claim culture paradoxically mean poetry potential postmodern anti postmodern art anthology period reflect unease contemporary poet critic embraced subsequently distanced elastic term although overlap poet represented anthology british poetry since striking divergence mark important decisive split postwar poetry britain poet grouping termed postmodern clearly number definition postmodern operation first linked branding dilution guise accessibility commodification intellectual creative activity become key feature postmodern era second relates formal conceptual feature postmodernism developed relation discipline architecture visual art editor new poetry describe selection emphasising accessibillity democracy responsiveness humour seriousness

What is the relationship between a cinema of slowness and a wider socio-cultural ""slow movement""? A body of films that shares a propensity toward slowness has emerged in many parts of the world over the past two decades. This is the first book to examine the concept of cinematic slowness and address this fascinating phenomenon in contemporary film culture. Providing a critical investigation into questions of temporality, materiality, and aesthetics, and examining concepts of authorship, cinephilia, and nostalgia, Song Hwee Lim offers insight into cinematic slowness through the films of the Malaysian-born, Taiwan-based director Tsai Ming-liang. Through detailed analysis of aspects of stillness and silence in cinema, Lim delineates the strategies by which slowness in film can be constructed. By drawing on writings on cinephilia and the films of directors such as Abbas Kiarostami, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Nuri Bilge Ceylan, he makes a passionate case for a slow cinema that calls for renewed attention to the image and to the experience of time in film. Tsai Ming-Liang and a Cinema of Slowness will speak to readers with an interest in art cinema, queer studies, East Asian culture, and the question of time. In an age of unrelenting acceleration of pace both in film and in life, this book invites us to pause and listen, to linger and look, and, above all, to take things slowly.",Art,2,0,qualify slowness cinema relationship cinema slowness wider sociocultural slow movement body film share propensity toward slowness emerged many part world past two decade first book examine concept cinematic slowness address fascinating phenomenon contemporary film culture providing critical investigation question temporality materiality aesthetic examining concept authorship cinephilia nostalgia song hwee lim offer insight cinematic slowness film malaysianborn taiwanbased director tsai mingliang detailed analysis aspect stillness silence cinema lim delineates strategy slowness film constructed drawing writing cinephilia film director abbas kiarostami hou hsiaohsien nuri bilge ceylan make passionate case slow cinema call renewed attention image experience time film tsai mingliang cinema slowness speak reader interest art cinema queer study east asian culture question time age unrelenting acceleration pace film life book invite u pause listen linger look take thing slowly

Yet viewers are often unaware of its presence. In this bold, insightful book, film and music scholar and critic Royal S. Brown invites readers not only to 'hear' the film score, but to understand it in relation to what they 'see'. Unlike earlier books, which offered historical, technical, and socio political analysis, ""Overtones and Undertones"" draws on film, music, and narrative theory to provide the first comprehensive aesthetics of film music. Focusing on how the film/score interaction influences our response to cinematic situations, Brown traces the history of film music from its beginnings, covering both American and European cinema. At the heart of his book are close readings of several of the best film/score interactions, including ""Psycho"", ""Laura"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""Double Indemnity"", and ""Pierrot le Fou"". In revealing interviews with Bernard Herrmann, Miklos Rosza, Henry Mancini, and others, Brown also allows the composers to speak for themselves.

For thousands of years Jews and Christians alike have preserved it in the canon of scripture and used it in liturgy. Exegetes saw it as a central text for allegorical interpretations, and so the Song of Songs has exerted an enormous influence on spirituality and mysticism in the Western tradition. In the Voice of My Beloved, E. Ann Matter focuses on the most fertile moment of Song of Songs interpretation: the Middle Ages. At least eighty Latin commentaries on the text survive from the period. In tracing the evolution of these commentaries, Matter reveals them to be a vehicle for expressing changing medieval ideas about the church, the relationship between body and soul, and human and divine love. She shows that the commentaries constitute a well-defined genre of medieval Latin literature. And in discussing the exegesis of the Song of Songs, she takes into account the modern exegesis of the book and feminist critiques of the theology embodied in the text.",Art,4,0,song song eight chapter love lyric found collection wisdom literature attributed solomon enigmatic book bible thousand year jew christian alike preserved canon scripture used liturgy exegete saw central text allegorical interpretation song song exerted enormous influence spirituality mysticism western tradition voice beloved e ann matter focus fertile moment song song interpretation middle age least eighty latin commentary text survive period tracing evolution commentary matter reveals vehicle expressing changing medieval idea church relationship body soul human divine love show commentary constitute welldefined genre medieval latin literature discussing exegesis song song take account modern exegesis book feminist critique theology embodied text

This expanded edition of a special issue of the ""South Atlantic Quarterly"" brings together scholars from various parts of the globe to discuss socialist realism as it appears across genres in art, architecture, film, and literature and across geographic divides - from the 'centre,' Russia, to various points at the 'periphery' - China, Germany, France, Poland, remote republics of the former USSR, and the United States.The contributors argue that socialist realism has never been a monolithic art form and demonstrate, among other things, that its literature could accommodate psychoanalytic criticism; that its art and architecture could affect the aesthetic dictates of Moscow that made 'Soviet' art paradoxically heterogeneous; and that its aesthetics could accommodate both high art and crafted kitsch. ""Socialist Realism without Shores"" also addresses the critical discourse provoked by socialist realism - Stalinist aesthetics, 'anthropological' readings; ideology critique and censorship; and the sublimely ironic approaches adapted from sots art, the Soviet version of postmodernism.

How to transcribe the accurate and authentic text was debated and eventually prescribed in detail in each tradition, but ultimately each religion adopted a different strategy. The Jewish tradition—which distinguishes between liturgical reading and study—developed two discrete formats of the Pentateuch. The ancient form of the scroll with the text inscribed in scripta defectiva was reserved for liturgical use, while the newer codex, written in scripta plena with vocalization and cantillation marks, was accepted for all other purposes. Muslim scholars were less concerned with preserving an ‘authentic’ form, and gradually allowed massive embellishment of the basic script, and a wide variety of designs. The two traditions regard a few early copies of their scriptures, notably the ʿUṯmānī Musḥaf(s) of the Qurʾān and the Aleppo Codex of the Torah, as particularly awe inspiring and holy, according them the role of “master copy” on the scholarly level, and bestowing them the veneration due sacred relics, on the popular level.",Art,3,0,jew muslim developed similar perception divine origin respective sacred scripture including aural graphic form transcribe accurate authentic text debated eventually prescribed detail tradition ultimately religion adopted different strategy jewish traditionwhich distinguishes liturgical reading studydeveloped two discrete format pentateuch ancient form scroll text inscribed scripta defectiva reserved liturgical use newer codex written scripta plenum vocalization cantillation mark accepted purpose muslim scholar le concerned preserving authentic form gradually allowed massive embellishment basic script wide variety design two tradition regard early copy scripture notably ʿuṯmānī musḥafs qurʾān aleppo codex torah particularly awe inspiring holy according role master copy scholarly level bestowing veneration due sacred relic popular level

The eaves of Korean tiled roofs were used to express the sky, and the round thatched roofs of commoners symbolized the sky as well. The early Christian vision of the universe developed under the effect of mysticism and Neoplatonism. And theological significance has been put upon the chapel roofs, as transcendence about sanctity growingly drew attention. The Byzantine Church of the East symbolized Corpus Christi, with its dome being both the cosmos that reflects the rank of heaven and the heavenly vault. Gothic architecture of the West is deeply related with deductive methodology in Universalienstreit of Scholasticism. It can be said that the ogival ceilings adds desire for heaven and eternity to the basic concept of the heavenly vault. The Protestant Church of modern Korea has maintained its architecture based on Gothicism which is related to Catholic ritual for a long time without particular theological examination. This can be said to rest on the medieval Catholic tradition, ‘the Church equals Gothicism itself.’ The modern Korean Church has to establish the theological meaning about the rood spire on its roofs and refrain from indiscriminate construction. And considering publicness of the church buildings, the spire has to be constructed under cooperation of architect and sculptor as an environmental and public sculpture, together with the church building. It has to be kept in mind that once the spire results in giving church buildings a negative image, there can possibly be negative perception of Christianity itself.",Art,4,0,every region roof symbolic significance representing folk culture eaves korean tiled roof used express sky round thatched roof commoner symbolized sky well early christian vision universe developed effect mysticism neoplatonism theological significance put upon chapel roof transcendence sanctity growingly drew attention byzantine church east symbolized corpus christi dome cosmos reflects rank heaven heavenly vault gothic architecture west deeply related deductive methodology universalienstreit scholasticism said ogival ceiling add desire heaven eternity basic concept heavenly vault protestant church modern korea maintained architecture based gothicism related catholic ritual long time without particular theological examination said rest medieval catholic tradition church equal gothicism modern korean church establish theological meaning rood spire roof refrain indiscriminate construction considering publicness church building spire constructed cooperation architect sculptor environmental public sculpture together church building kept mind spire result giving church building negative image possibly negative perception christianity

Initial examination revealed that it had been heavily over-restored in the nineteenth century. All these additions were removed during cleaning. The original terracotta relief was examined in great detail and this established the stages and techniques used in its construction and showed that it was an original piece of sculpture and not a copy. Thermoluminescence dating proved that the relief was made between 1416 and 1546 and a comparison of composition and style suggests that a date in the 1460s is appropriate.,Art,2,0,detailed technological scientific examination carried terracotta relief sculpture madonna child attributed school verrocchio birmingham museum art gallery since never previously examined detail although one authority dismissed nineteenth century copy initial examination revealed heavily overrestored nineteenth century addition removed cleaning original terracotta relief examined great detail established stage technique used construction showed original piece sculpture copy thermoluminescence dating proved relief made comparison composition style suggests date appropriate

A fifth sculpture related to the Lesser Dedication in Athens (i.e., the mounted Amazon killing a barbarian now in the Palazzo Massimo in Rome) is carved from Carrara marble. To identify the marble of the Large Gauls with confidence it was necessary to find a means to discriminate clearly between Docimian marble and the white marbles of the newly discovered quarry at Göktepe near Aphrodisias. The usual multi-method approach for marble identification, which combines petrographic, isotopic, and electron paramagnetic resonance data, proved to be unsuitable in this case. Additional techniques were tested, and the answer proved to be strontium trace analysis.

The Judeo-Christian God has been relegated as a figure of the past and characterized as a later development from the polytheistic religions of the Ancient Near East into a monotheism that would eventually evolve into the secular atheistic society we have today. This caricatured view of God has been predominate in our western society and has been deeply caricaturized by scholars in the humanities and the sciences. Due to these assumptions, this paper seeks to reassess these claims in light of their historical factuality. The methodology we have employed in our work is a comparative study between the portrayals of the monotheistic father God in the Psalms by the Hebrew authors and that of the polytheistic father gods seen throughout the Ancient Near East. We have restricted our study to the Psalms since it is here were we have a large variety of father imagery in the metaphors employed by the Psalmists. By investigating carefully these passages in the Psalms and comparing them with their Ancient Near Eastern counterparts we will see that the depictions of God are very different from the anthropomorphic notions ascribed to Him by the Ancient Near Eastern cultures. Keyowords: Old testament; Fatherhood language; western society; biblical interpretation Resumo Desde o alvorecer do Iluminismo, a sociedade ocidental tem procurado se emancipar de qualquer conexao com uma nocao do divino.

Essa visao caricatural de Deus tem sido predominante em nossa sociedade ocidental e profundamente parodiada por estudiosos das humanidades e das ciencias. Este artigo visa, portanto, reavaliar essas afirmacoes a luz de sua factualidade historica.

Restringimos nosso estudo aos Salmos, pois e aqui onde temos uma grande variedade de imagens de pai nas metaforas empregadas pelos salmistas. Ao investigar cuidadosamente essas passagens nos Salmos e compara-las com suas contrapartes do Antigo Oriente Proximo, veremos que as representacoes de Deus sao muito diferentes das nocoes antropomorficas atribuidas a ele pelas culturas do Antigo Oriente Proximo.

Additionally, activation of NF-κB in cancer cells by chemotherapy or by radiation can blunt the ability of the cancer therapy to induce cell death.

The activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ionizing radiation, or daunorubicin (a cancer chemotherapeutic compound), was found to protect from cell killing. Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation enhanced apoptotic killing by these reagents but not by apoptotic stimuli that do not activate NF-κB.

We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First, proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation.",Biology,2,0,major pathway eukaryotic messenger rna mrna turnover begin deadenylation followed decapping exonucleolytic decay provide evidence mrna decapping degradation occur discrete cytoplasmic focus yeast call processing body p body first protein activate catalyze decapping concentrated p body second inhibiting mrna turnover decapping lead loss p body however inhibiting turnover decapping increase abundance size p body finally mrna degradation intermediate localized p body result define flux mrna polysomes p body critical aspect cytoplasmic mrna metabolism possible site regulation mrna degradation

Three essential hallmarks define ferroptosis, namely: the loss of lipid peroxide repair capacity by the phospholipid hydroperoxidase GPX4, the availability of redox-active iron, and oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phospholipids. Several processes including RAS/MAPK signaling, amino acid and iron metabolism, ferritinophagy, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, and mevalonate and phospholipid biosynthesis can modulate susceptibility to ferroptosis. Ferroptosis sensitivity is also governed by p53 and KEAP1/NRF2 activity, linking ferroptosis to the function of key tumor suppressor pathways. Together these findings highlight the role of ferroptosis as an emerging concept in cancer biology and an attractive target for precision cancer medicine discovery.",Biology,4,0,ferroptosis nonapoptotic irondependent form cell death activated cancer cell natural stimulus synthetic agent three essential hallmark define ferroptosis namely loss lipid peroxide repair capacity phospholipid hydroperoxidase gpx availability redoxactive iron oxidation polyunsaturated fatty acid pufacontaining phospholipid several process including rasmapk signaling amino acid iron metabolism ferritinophagy epithelialtomesenchymal transition cell adhesion mevalonate phospholipid biosynthesis modulate susceptibility ferroptosis ferroptosis sensitivity also governed p keapnrf activity linking ferroptosis function key tumor suppressor pathway together finding highlight role ferroptosis emerging concept cancer biology attractive target precision cancer medicine discovery

321,c4ca410c08423ee44d93616b798eeb39fbe3c5e4,XXXIII. Extinct Birds,"The lecturer observed that comparative anatomy showed that birds were more nearly allied to reptiles than to mammals, however striking the external differences between them might be. Hence the late Professor Huxley had included birds and reptiles in one common group—the Sauropsida. Evolutionists believed that birds had originated from reptiles, though it was not known from what order of reptiles they were descended. The resemblances between birds and the Pterodactyles, or winged reptiles of the Jurassic epoch, were merely adaptive, but some of the likewise extinct order of Dinosauria had certainly bird-like osteological peculiarities. It was, however, interesting to know that the oldest known fossil bird—the Archæopteryx of the Upper Jurassic—was more reptile-like than any later bird, inasmuch as it had teeth in its jaws, a less specialised anterior extremity, and the caudal part of the vertebral column was elongated and tapering. The Archæopteryx formed one of the three great divisions into which birds were classed by Huxley—namely, the Saururae, or lizard-tailed; the other two being the Ratitæ, or ostrich-like birds, and the Carinatae, which included the overwhelming majority of living species. The Ratitæ comprised the Ostrich, the Emu, &c, running birds with degenerate wings, and consequently incapable of flight. Remains referred to Ratitæ have been found in Tertiary strata, but the most complete were those from the more recent accumulations, such as the Æpiornis, or Giant Bird, of Madagascar, eggs of which have been found measuring 14 inches in length; and the huge Moas of New Zealand, some of",Biology,3,0,lecturer observed comparative anatomy showed bird nearly allied reptile mammal however striking external difference might hence late professor huxley included bird reptile one common groupthe sauropsida evolutionist believed bird originated reptile though known order reptile descended resemblance bird pterodactyles winged reptile jurassic epoch merely adaptive likewise extinct order dinosauria certainly birdlike osteological peculiarity however interesting know oldest known fossil birdthe archæopteryx upper jurassicwas reptilelike later bird inasmuch teeth jaw le specialised anterior extremity caudal part vertebral column elongated tapering archæopteryx formed one three great division bird classed huxleynamely saururae lizardtailed two ratitæ ostrichlike bird carinatae included overwhelming majority living specie ratitæ comprised ostrich emu c running bird degenerate wing consequently incapable flight remains referred ratitæ found tertiary stratum complete recent accumulation æpiornis giant bird madagascar egg found measuring inch length huge moa new zealand

Unfortunately, the “polyphyletic” origin identified for several reptilian orders, as well as difficulties in assuming that extant forms studied are representative of reptiles ancestral to mammals, renders attempts at evolutionary interpretation hazardous if one attempts to sustain the common practice of imposing a mammalian framework and nomenclature for identifying homologous structures. Although the principal role of comparative anatomy lies in the establishment of homologies on the basis of form and relations, modern investigations have extended beyond paleontological approaches and have begun to apply a variety of experimental methods in an effort to ascertain functional correlates.

Mimivirus is a double-stranded DNA virus growing in amoebae. We now present its 1,181,404–base pair genome sequence, consisting of 1262 putative open reading frames, 10% of which exhibit a similarity to proteins of known functions. In addition to exceptional genome size, Mimivirus exhibits many features that distinguish it from other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. The most unexpected is the presence of numerous genes encoding central protein-translation components, including four amino-acyl transfer RNA synthetases, peptide release factor 1, translation elongation factor EF-TU, and translation initiation factor 1. The genome also exhibits six tRNAs. Other notable features include the presence of both type I and type II topoisomerases, components of all DNA repair pathways, many polysaccharide synthesis enzymes, and one intein-containing gene.

Alevins reared in astro-turf absorbed their yolk sac faster and more efficiently than alevins reared on a flat screen. Alevins reared on the flat screen developed yolk sac constrictions probably due to the backward and lateral force created by the high swimming activity.

Since that time contributions have been made to the knowledge of the region in the alligator (Huber and Crosby, '26), chameleon (Shanklin, '30, '33) , Lacerta (Frederikse, '31), turtles, (Papez, '35, '36), and various other reptiles (Huber and Crosby, '33 ; Kappers, Huber and Crosby, '36). Kuhlenbeck ('31) figured the nucleus posterodorsalis in the dorsal thalamus of Lacerta and turtles. There has, however, been much confusion in the identification of comparable structures in different animals. Recently a further structure was described by Papez in various forms which had not been clearly identified by other authors. In the comparative and descriptive anatomy of the brain, the posterior commissure has long been considered the boundary between the diencephalon and the mesencephalon. There exists some doubt, however, as to whether this commissure and its nuclei should be interpreted as diencephalic or mesencephalic structures.

The anatomy, histology and histochemical of the alimentary canal of Chamaeleon africanus, a purely insectivorous reptile, was studied. The oesophagus of Chamaeleon africanus was a comparatively short tube. It contains oesophageal glands and is lined with ciliated columnar epithelium and goblet cells. The morphological limit between the oesophagus and stomach of Chamaeleon is accompanied by histological differences. The stomach contains mucous glands. The gastric mucosa is composed of simple columnar cells and many tubular glands. The small intestine is comparatively short and is not differentiated externally into duodenum and ileum. The duodenal mucosa is in the form of villi which unite forming a reticulum. The ileum opens into a short and wide rectum. The large intestine can be differentiated into a colon and a rectum. The lining of the large intestine was goblet and columnar absorptive cells. The rectum is provided with a small caecum as digestion takes place quickly by the strong digestive enzymes. Acid and natural mucopolysaccharides were detected in the gut mucosa. PAS positive matter is found in the entire alimentary tract.

337,38ee08e4c36f55dbbde2e8439dd9a9c9550be8bd,"The language of systematics, and the philosophy of ‘total evidence’","Abstract This contribution analyses the primacy of classification over generalization, and the philosophy of total evidence that emerges from the relation of homology to character statements. Primary conjectures of homology are basic character statements, i.e. statements that predicate properties of organisms, properties that are instantiated by those organisms and/or their parts. Secondary conjectures of homology are embedded in a second‐level (metalinguistic) discourse that turns on the coherence or incoherence of those basic character statements relative to a hierarchy. The coherence or incoherence of character statements is a logical relation between statements, not a causal (historical) relation between organisms. The choice of the hypothesis of relationships that is supported by the largest set of coherent basic character statements is based on the empirical presupposition that the properties referred to by the set of coherent character statements are grounded in causally efficacious relations of inheritance and ontogeny, and co‐instantiated because they are inherited through common ancestry (Hennig's auxiliary principle). Unless that empirical presupposition is causally grounded, phylogeny reconstruction is of an inherently probabilistic nature, whether under parsimony or other models of analysis. The causal grounding of a coherent set of character statements typically seeks a link between character statements and causally efficacious generative mechanisms for morphological characters (as is defeasibly indicated by topology and connectivity), or secondary structure information for molecular characters.",Biology,4,0,abstract contribution analysis primacy classification generalization philosophy total evidence emerges relation homology character statement primary conjecture homology basic character statement ie statement predicate property organism property instantiated organism andor part secondary conjecture homology embedded secondlevel metalinguistic discourse turn coherence incoherence basic character statement relative hierarchy coherence incoherence character statement logical relation statement causal historical relation organism choice hypothesis relationship supported largest set coherent basic character statement based empirical presupposition property referred set coherent character statement grounded causally efficacious relation inheritance ontogeny coinstantiated inherited common ancestry hennigs auxiliary principle unless empirical presupposition causally grounded phylogeny reconstruction inherently probabilistic nature whether parsimony model analysis causal grounding coherent set character statement typically seek link character statement causally efficacious generative mechanism morphological character defeasibly indicated topology connectivity secondary structure information molecular character

339,5292bf6f3a2dec9a214c3642936972fcb62ad850,Classification and genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition.,"A suggested classification of numeric anomalies of teeth is a trimodal classification: anodontia, hypodontia, and hyperdontia. A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

Bleaching can be the result of loss of the pigmented algae from the host or of loss of pigment from the algae. This article considers only the phenomenon of algal loss. Most attention has been directed to bleaching in scleractinian (hard) corals in the tropics (e.g., Brown 1990, Glynn 1990, Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1990). It is a subject of concern because of mortality and local extinctions associated with large-scale bleaching episodes (Glynn and de Weert 1991; but see Glynn and Feingold 1992), the widespread belief that bleaching episodes have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity within the past decade (D'Elia et al. 1991), and speculation about possible links to global warming (Glynn",Biology,4,0,leaching organism hard soft coral giant clam sea anemone loss pigment associated symbiotic algae zooxanthellae bleaching result loss pigmented algae host loss pigment algae article considers phenomenon algal loss attention directed bleaching scleractinian hard coral tropic eg brown glynn williams bunkleywilliams subject concern mortality local extinction associated largescale bleaching episode glynn de weert see glynn feingold widespread belief bleaching episode increased dramatically frequency intensity within past decade delia et al speculation possible link global warming glynn

Rathke as early as 1839 observed the continuity of the columella and hyoid arch in snakes. The comparative anatomy of the lacertilian columella auris has been exhaustively studied by Versluys ('03) and was shown by him to be composed of two morphologically distinct parts, a median segment, the stapes, closing the fenestra vestibuli, and a lateral segment, the extracolumella, which remains cartilaginous through life and whose outer end is attached to the tympanic membrane. The independence in origin of columella and otic capsule has not been recognized, however, by all investigators although at the present time the evidence is quite convincing that the columella auris is entirely extra-capsular in origin. In Lacertilia, according to Versluys, the extracolumella apparently takes part in the completion of the hyoid arch and in fact i t has been termed the hyostapes by Hoffman ('89) in contradistinction to the otostapes, which that investigator regarded as of labyrinthine origin. I n Testudo, according to Bender (,ll), the columella is united with the hyale by means of the interhyale and the extracolumella lies wholly external to the arch which is made up of the cornu hyale, interhyale, and columella.

This algorithm runs in (v) O(g) steps where v is the number of vertices of G. We believe that removing the nondiscrete topological definitions (i.e., the notation or differentiability, 2-dimensional surface, etc.) from our formal definitions has a multitude of advantages. First our goal is to produce an algorithm which operates on discrete machines and thus at some point we must remove these notions anyway. Secondly, demonstrations on proofs in the amalgam of graph theory and topology have been riddled with flaws (e.g., 4-color theorem, planarity algorithms, Jordan curve theorem), and which, no doubt, this paper also suffers. The hope is that a combinatorial proof may transcend these problems.

Our protocol supports multiple broadcast domains, resolves the wireless hidden node problem and allows for parallel transmissions across a mesh network.

The protocol relies on bit-dominance similar to what is used in the CAN bus except that in order to operate on a wireless physical layer, nodes are not required to receive incoming bits while transmitting. The use of bit-dominance efficiently allows for a much larger number of priorities than would be possible using existing wireless solutions.

Resulting from these user requirements, system requirements and a system architecture for the ICARUS system were deduced.

Our extensible algebraic datatypes with defaults yield a simple programming protocol for implementing extensible and reusable compiler passes in a functional style.

Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints.

However, automatic parallelization is frequently limited by the imprecision of static analysis. Moreover, due to the inherent fragility of static analysis, small changes to the source code can significantly undermine performance. By replacing static analysis with speculation and profiling, automatic parallelization becomes more robust and applicable. A naïve automatic speculative parallelization does not scale for distributed memory clusters, due to the high bandwidth required to validate speculation. This work is the first automatic speculative DOALL (Spec-DOALL) parallelization system for clusters. We have implemented a prototype automatic parallelization system, called Cluster Spec-DOALL, which consists of a Spec-DOALL parallelizing compiler and a speculative runtime for clusters. Since the compiler optimizes communication patterns, and the runtime is optimized for the cases in which speculation succeeds, Cluster Spec-DOALL minimizes the communication and validation overheads of the speculative runtime. Across 8 benchmarks, Cluster Spec-DOALL achieves a geomean speedup of 43.8x on a 120-core cluster, whereas DOALL without speculation achieves only 4.5x speedup.

The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance—it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration.
PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with the IBM compiler, PL/C permits “pseudo comments”—constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source text or comment.
In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor. It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.",Computer Science,1,0,plc compiler dialect pli design objective provide maximum degree diagnostic assistance batch processing environment part assistance implicit provided automatically compiler remarkable characteristic plc perseveranceit completes translation every program submitted continues execution userestablished error limit reached requires compiler repair error encountered translation execution design plc dominated consideration plc also introduces several explicit usercontrolled facility program testing accommodate extension pli without abandoning compatibility ibm compiler plc permit pseudo commentsconstructions whose content optionally considered either source text comment spite diagnostic effort plc fast efficient processor effectively demonstrates compiler provide better diagnostic assistance customarily offered even sophisticated source language employed assistance need prohibitively costly

It may be viewed as the computer-age equivalent of minimal art. Its goals are based on concepts from algorithmic information theory. A low-complexity artwork can be specified by a computer algorithm and should comply with two properties: (1) the drawing should “look right,” and (2) the Kolmogorov complexity of the drawing should be small (the algorithm should be short) and a typical observer should be able to see this. Examples of low-complexity art are given in the form of algorithmically simple cartoons of various objects. Attempts are made to relate the formalism of the theory of minimum description length to informal notions such as “good artistic style” and “beauty.”",Computer Science,2,0,many artist representing object try convey essence attempt formalize certain aspect depicting essence object author proposes art form called lowcomplexity art may viewed computerage equivalent minimal art goal based concept algorithmic information theory lowcomplexity artwork specified computer algorithm comply two property drawing look right kolmogorov complexity drawing small algorithm short typical observer able see example lowcomplexity art given form algorithmically simple cartoon various object attempt made relate formalism theory minimum description length informal notion good artistic style beauty

398,67ae1bfa6ddd392c04c84e4a8be24341e7e43751,Behaviour coordination for navigation in office environments,"Behaviour coordination is a notorious problem in mobile robotics. Behaviours are either in competition or collaborating to achieve the goals of a system, which leads to requirements for arbitration and/or fusion of control signals. In most systems the arbitration is specified in terms of ""events"" that denote positions or sensory input. The detection of these events allows discrete switching between groups of behaviours. In contrast, the fusion of behaviours is often achieved using potential fields, fuzzy rules, or superposition. In most cases, the underlying theoretical foundation is rather weak and the behaviour switching results in discrete changes in the overall system dynamics. In this paper, we present a scheme for behaviour coordination that is grounded in the dynamical systems approach. The methodology provides a solid theoretical basis for analysis and design of a behaviour coordination framework. This framework is demonstrated in the context of a domestic robot for fetch-and-carry type tasks. It is here shown that behaviour coordination can be analyzed as an integral part of the design to facilitate smooth transition and fusion between behaviours.",Computer Science,3,0,behaviour coordination notorious problem mobile robotics behaviour either competition collaborating achieve goal system lead requirement arbitration andor fusion control signal system arbitration specified term event denote position sensory input detection event allows discrete switching group behaviour contrast fusion behaviour often achieved using potential field fuzzy rule superposition case underlying theoretical foundation rather weak behaviour switching result discrete change overall system dynamic paper present scheme behaviour coordination grounded dynamical system approach methodology provides solid theoretical basis analysis design behaviour coordination framework framework demonstrated context domestic robot fetchandcarry type task shown behaviour coordination analyzed integral part design facilitate smooth transition fusion behaviour

In this paper, we present a distributed sequential auction scheme that takes the UAV limitations into account and provides a systematic procedure for the auction process. The task allocation scheme first validates the targets using neighbor's knowledge and then, depending on the decisions obtained from neighbors, an agent decides to auction or forfeit the target. The targets detected within a sensor range are validated and auctioned sequentially. A simulation study was conducted for different sensor and communication ranges to evaluate the performance of the sequential auction scheme which was compared with a greedy strategy and a simple distributed auction scheme. The results show that the sequential auction scheme performs better than the simple distributed auction and greedy strategy.",Computer Science,3,0,allocating task efficiently multiple uavs limited sensor communication range difficult problem paper present distributed sequential auction scheme take uav limitation account provides systematic procedure auction process task allocation scheme first validates target using neighbor knowledge depending decision obtained neighbor agent decides auction forfeit target target detected within sensor range validated auctioned sequentially simulation study conducted different sensor communication range evaluate performance sequential auction scheme compared greedy strategy simple distributed auction scheme result show sequential auction scheme performs better simple distributed auction greedy strategy

Nearly 95% of Bitcoin's and 80% of Ethereum's mining power resides with less than ten and six mining pools respectively. Although miners benefit from low payout variance in pooled mining, centralized mining pools require members to trust that pool operators will remunerate them fairly. Furthermore, centralized pools pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up possibilities for collusion between pools for perpetrating severe attacks. 
 
In this work, we propose SMARTPOOL, a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. Our protocol shows how one can leverage smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining. SMARTPOOL gives transaction selection control back to miners while yielding low-variance payouts. SMARTPOOL incurs mining fees lower than centralized mining pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SMARTPOOL implementation on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. To date, our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, costing miners a mere 0:6% of block rewards in transaction fees.",Computer Science,4,0,cryptocurrencies bitcoin ethereum operated handful mining pool nearly bitcoins ethereums mining power resides le ten six mining pool respectively although miner benefit low payout variance pooled mining centralized mining pool require member trust pool operator remunerate fairly furthermore centralized pool pose risk transaction censorship pool operator open possibility collusion pool perpetrating severe attack work propose smartpool novel protocol design decentralized mining pool protocol show one leverage smart contract autonomous blockchain program decentralize cryptocurrency mining smartpool give transaction selection control back miner yielding lowvariance payouts smartpool incurs mining fee lower centralized mining pool designed scale large number miner implemented deployed robust smartpool implementation ethereum ethereum classic network date deployed pool handled peak hashrate ghs ethereum miner resulting block costing miner mere block reward transaction fee

Such difficulty stems from the complexity of the abstract notions involved and the required mathematical background. Surveys conducted among our students showed that many of them were applying some theoretical concepts mechanically rather than developing a significant learning of them, leading to a lack of motivation and interest. To cope with this problem, we introduced a number of didactic strategies based on a constructivist approach. The main aim of the proposed strategies is to promote a more significant learning of several important FLAT topics.",Computer Science,4,0,undergraduate course formal language automaton theory flat involves different topic core c curriculum whose level abstraction make difficult teach learn difficulty stem complexity abstract notion involved required mathematical background survey conducted among student showed many applying theoretical concept mechanically rather developing significant learning leading lack motivation interest cope problem introduced number didactic strategy based constructivist approach main aim proposed strategy promote significant learning several important flat topic

Each of these optimization procedures has a preferred domain: that is, some algorithms prefer to operate over the input string, others over the tree which describes the syntax of the string, others over the ""macro-instructions"" which are generated from the tree, and so forth. In an earlier paper, one of the present authors pointed out the necessity for employing the tree form in particular as a natural domain for optimizers which consider syntactic context and suggested that, just as Irons and others had built general-purpose table-driven parsing algorithms, one could also build a general-purpose table-driven program for getting from trees to macro-instructions.

Interface automata is a game-based model, which allows to make assumptions on the environment and propose an optimistic view for composition : two components can be composed if there is an environment where they can work together. Modal specification is a language theoretic account of a fragment of the modal mu-calculus logic that is more complete but which does not allow to distinguish between the environment and the component. Partial unifications of these two frameworks have been explored recently. A first attempt by Larsen et al. considers modal interfaces, an extension of modal specifications that deals with compatibility issues in the composition operator. However, this composition operator is incorrect. A second attempt by Raclet et al. gives a different perspective, and emphasises on conjunction and residuation of modal specifications, including when interfaces have dissimilar alphabets, but disregards interface compatibility. The present paper contributes a thorougher unification of the two theories by correcting the modal interface composition operator presented in the paper by Larsen et al., drawing a complete picture of the modal interface algebra, and pushing even further the comparison between interface automata, modal automata and modal interfaces.",Computer Science,4,0,paper present unification interface automaton modal specification two radically dissimilar model interface theory interface automaton gamebased model allows make assumption environment propose optimistic view composition two component composed environment work together modal specification language theoretic account fragment modal mucalculus logic complete allow distinguish environment component partial unification two framework explored recently first attempt larsen et al considers modal interface extension modal specification deal compatibility issue composition operator however composition operator incorrect second attempt raclet et al give different perspective emphasis conjunction residuation modal specification including interface dissimilar alphabet disregard interface compatibility present paper contributes thorougher unification two theory correcting modal interface composition operator presented paper larsen et al drawing complete picture modal interface algebra pushing even comparison interface automaton modal automaton modal interface

The environment applies the notion of split-level programming to relieve system engineers of software engineering concerns and to let them focus on system architecture. The script language is a Component Integration Language (CIL) because it implements a component model with introspection and loose typing capabilities. Component wrappers use split-level interfaces that implement the composition rules, dynamic type determination and type inference algorithms. Using an interface description language compiler automatically generates the split-level interfaces.

446,2373b801838e095ab2c2e85f8acce8898caf46bb,"Beating in-order stalls with ""flea-flicker"" two-pass pipelining","While compilers have generally proven adept at planning useful static instruction-level parallelism for in-order microarchitectures, the efficient accommodation of unanticipateable latencies, like those of load instructions, remains a vexing problem. Traditional out-of-order execution hides some of these latencies, but repeats scheduling work already done by the compiler and adds additional pipeline overhead. Other techniques, such as prefetching and multithreading, can hide some anticipateable, long-latency misses, but not the shorter, more diffuse stalls due to difficult-to-anticipate, first or second-level misses. Our work proposes a microarchitectural technique, two-pass pipelining, whereby the program executes on two in-order back-end pipelines coupled by a queue. The ""advance"" pipeline often defers instructions dispatching with unready operands rather than stalling. The ""backup"" pipeline allows concurrent resolution of instructions deferred by the first pipeline allowing overlapping of useful ""advanced"" execution with miss resolution. An accompanying compiler technique and instruction marking further enhance the handling of miss latencies. Applying our technique to an Itanium 2-like design achieves a speedup of 1.38x in mcf, the most memory-intensive SPECint2000 benchmark, and an average of 1.12 x across other selected benchmarks, yielding between 32 percent and 67 percent of an idealized out-of-order design's speedup at a much lower design cost and complexity.",Computer Science,4,0,compiler generally proven adept planning useful static instructionlevel parallelism inorder microarchitectures efficient accommodation unanticipateable latency like load instruction remains vexing problem traditional outoforder execution hide latency repeat scheduling work already done compiler add additional pipeline overhead technique prefetching multithreading hide anticipateable longlatency miss shorter diffuse stall due difficulttoanticipate first secondlevel miss work proposes microarchitectural technique twopass pipelining whereby program executes two inorder backend pipeline coupled queue advance pipeline often defers instruction dispatching unready operand rather stalling backup pipeline allows concurrent resolution instruction deferred first pipeline allowing overlapping useful advanced execution miss resolution accompanying compiler technique instruction marking enhance handling miss latency applying technique itanium like design achieves speedup x mcf memoryintensive specint benchmark average x across selected benchmark yielding percent percent idealized outoforder design speedup much lower design cost complexity

The language has been designed to be easy to learn and to use by people (for example, secretaries and mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor typesetting. Experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically. For example, the input sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i = pi over 2 produces ∑∞i=0xi = &pgr;/2 The syntax of the language is specified by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting commands. Output may be produced on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply.

Load speculation techniques have been proposed to reduce this latency. Dependence Prediction can be used to allow loads to be issued before all prior store addresses are known, and to predict exactly which store a load should wait upon. Address Prediction can be used to allow a load to bypass the calculation of its effective address and speculatively issue. Value Prediction can be used to bypass the load forward latency and avoid cache misses. Memory renaming has been proposed to communicate stored values directly to aliased loads. In this paper we examine in detail the interaction and performance tradeoffs of these four load speculation techniques in the presence of two miss-speculation recovery architectures-reexecution and squash. We examine the performance of combining these techniques to create a load speculation chooser which provides performance improvement over using any one technique in isolation. We also examine the accuracy of these load speculation techniques for predicting data cache misses.",Computer Science,4,0,load latency remains significant bottleneck dynamically scheduled pipelined processor load speculation technique proposed reduce latency dependence prediction used allow load issued prior store address known predict exactly store load wait upon address prediction used allow load bypass calculation effective address speculatively issue value prediction used bypass load forward latency avoid cache miss memory renaming proposed communicate stored value directly aliased load paper examine detail interaction performance tradeoff four load speculation technique presence two missspeculation recovery architecturesreexecution squash examine performance combining technique create load speculation chooser provides performance improvement using one technique isolation also examine accuracy load speculation technique predicting data cache miss

The core of the paper is self-contained, consisting as it does essentially of the two notions of “p-definability” and the five algebraic relations that are proved as theorems.

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words.

486,07956c7cf9bf4267b86d52aa4143c17a4aa5d0d6,CNP: An FPGA-based processor for Convolutional Networks,"Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are biologicallyinspired hierarchical architectures that can be trained to perform a variety of detection, recognition and segmentation tasks. ConvNets have a feed-forward architecture consisting of multiple linear convolution filters interspersed with pointwise non-linear squashing functions. This paper presents an efficient implementation of ConvNets on a low-end DSPoriented Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The implementation exploits the inherent parallelism of ConvNets and takes full advantage of multiple hardware multiplyaccumulate units on the FPGA. The entire system uses a single FPGA with an external memory module, and no extra parts. A network compiler software was implemented, which takes a description of a trained ConvNet and compiles it into a sequence of instructions for the ConvNet Processor (CNP). A ConvNet face detection system was implemented and tested. Face detection on a 512 × 384 frame takes 100ms (10 frames per second), which corresponds to an average performance of 3.4×109 connections per second for this 340 million connection network. The design can be used for low-power, lightweight embedded vision systems for micro-UAVs and other small robots.",Computer Science,1,0,convolutional network convnets biologicallyinspired hierarchical architecture trained perform variety detection recognition segmentation task convnets feedforward architecture consisting multiple linear convolution filter interspersed pointwise nonlinear squashing function paper present efficient implementation convnets lowend dsporiented field programmable gate array fpga implementation exploit inherent parallelism convnets take full advantage multiple hardware multiplyaccumulate unit fpga entire system us single fpga external memory module extra part network compiler software implemented take description trained convnet compiles sequence instruction convnet processor cnp convnet face detection system implemented tested face detection frame take m frame per second corresponds average performance connection per second million connection network design used lowpower lightweight embedded vision system microuavs small robot

It takes a standard, portable OpenACC C program as input and generates a hardware configuration file for execution on FPGAs. We implemented this prototype system using our open-source OpenARC compiler, it performs source-to-source translation and optimization of the input OpenACC program into an OpenCL code, which is further compiled into a FPGA program by the backend Altera Offline OpenCL compiler. Internally, the design of OpenARC uses a high-level intermediate representation that separates concerns of program representation from underlying architectures, which facilitates portability of OpenARC. In fact, this design allowed us to create the OpenACC-to-FPGA translation framework with minimal extensions to our existing system. In addition, we show that our proposed FPGA-specific compiler optimizations and novel OpenACC pragma extensions assist the compiler in generating more efficient FPGA hardware configuration files. Our empirical evaluation on an Altera Stratix V FPGA with eight OpenACC benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of our strategy. To demonstrate the portability of OpenARC, we show results for the same benchmarks executing on other heterogeneous platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Intel Xeon Phis.

These very successful techniques reduce dense-time language inclusion problems to discrete time, but are applicable only when the implementation is closed under digitization and the specification is closed under inverse digitization. We show that, for timed automata, the former (whether the implementation is closed under digitization) is decidable, but not the latter. We also investigate digitization questions in connection with the robust semantics for timed automata. The robust modeling approach introduces a timing fuzziness through the semantic removal of equality testing. Since its introduction half a decade ago, research into the robust semantics has suggested that it yields roughly the same theory as the standard semantics. This paper shows that, surprisingly, this is not the case: the robust semantics is significantly less tractable, and differs from the standard semantics in many key respects. In particular, the robust semantics yields an undecidable (nonregular) discrete-time theory, in stark contrast with the standard semantics. This makes it virtually impossible to apply digitization techniques together with the robust semantics. On the positive side, we show that the robust languages of timed automata remain recursive.",Computer Science,4,0,consider several question related use digitization technique timed automaton successful technique reduce densetime language inclusion problem discrete time applicable implementation closed digitization specification closed inverse digitization show timed automaton former whether implementation closed digitization decidable latter also investigate digitization question connection robust semantics timed automaton robust modeling approach introduces timing fuzziness semantic removal equality testing since introduction half decade ago research robust semantics suggested yield roughly theory standard semantics paper show surprisingly case robust semantics significantly le tractable differs standard semantics many key respect particular robust semantics yield undecidable nonregular discretetime theory stark contrast standard semantics make virtually impossible apply digitization technique together robust semantics positive side show robust language timed automaton remain recursive

Local variables and stack locations are replaced by pseudo-registers eliminating the 32-bit restriction on address types. A fast register allocation algorithm is applied to map the pseudo-registers to machine registers. During code generation, field offsets are computed for proper alignment on 64-bit architectures. Even though the CACAO system has to incur loading and compilation time, it executes Java programs up to 85 times faster than the JDK interpreter, and up to seven times faster than the kaffe JIT compiler.

To this purpose, rather than limit our investigation to high-level (e.g. throughput and delay) performance figures, we take a closer look at their detailed operation, also in terms of low-level performance metrics (e.g., the probability of accessing specific channel slots). Our investigation on one hand confirms that AIFS differentiation provides superior and more robust operation than contention window differentiation. On the other hand, it highlights performance issues related to the coexistence between 802.11e contention-based stations with legacy 802.11 stations, and provides guidelines for the 802.11e parameter settings when such a coexistence is the goal.",Computer Science,4,0,ieee e task group reached stable consensus two basic contentionbased priority mechanism promote standardization usage different arbitration interframe space usage different minimummaximum contention window goal article provide thorough understanding principle behind operation purpose rather limit investigation highlevel eg throughput delay performance figure take closer look detailed operation also term lowlevel performance metric eg probability accessing specific channel slot investigation one hand confirms aifs differentiation provides superior robust operation contention window differentiation hand highlight performance issue related coexistence e contentionbased station legacy station provides guideline e parameter setting coexistence goal

In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.",Computer Science,1,0,ray tracing ray casting form point sampling important technique computer graphic usefulness undermined aliasing artifact paper shown artifact inherent part point sampling consequence using regularly spaced sample sample occur appropriate nonuniformly spaced location frequency nyquist limit alias instead appear noise correct average intensity noise much le objectionable visual system aliasing ray tracing ray stochastically distributed perform monte carlo evaluation integral rendering equation called distributed ray tracing used simulate motion blur depth field penumbra gloss translucency

519,66b57ffe58f2c98f3b7ac09e4f81bab6732ff2ea,Timeliness via speculation for real-time databases,"Various concurrency control algorithms differ in the time when conflicts are detected, and in the way they are resolved. Pessimistic (PCC) protocols detect conflicts as soon as they occur and resolve them using blocking. Optimistic (OCC) protocols detect conflicts at transaction commit time and resolve them using rollbacks. For real-time databases, blockages and rollbacks are hazards that increase the likelihood of transactions missing their deadlines. We propose a Speculative Concurrency Control (SCC) technique that minimizes the impact of block ages and rollbacks. SCC relies on added system resources to speculate on potential serialization orders, ensuring that if such serialization orders materialize, the hazards of blockages and roll-back are minimized. We present a number of SCC-based algorithms that differ in the level of speculation they introduce, and the amount of System resources (mainly memory) they require. We show the performance gains (in terms of number of satisfied timing constraints) to be expected when a representative SCC algorithm (SCC-2S) is adopted.<<ETX>>",Computer Science,3,0,various concurrency control algorithm differ time conflict detected way resolved pessimistic pcc protocol detect conflict soon occur resolve using blocking optimistic occ protocol detect conflict transaction commit time resolve using rollback realtime database blockage rollback hazard increase likelihood transaction missing deadline propose speculative concurrency control scc technique minimizes impact block age rollback scc relies added system resource speculate potential serialization order ensuring serialization order materialize hazard blockage rollback minimized present number sccbased algorithm differ level speculation introduce amount system resource mainly memory require show performance gain term number satisfied timing constraint expected representative scc algorithm sccs adoptedetx

Further that even relativising it to an observer has problems. It is proposed that complexity can be only usefully applied to constructions within a given language. It is argued that complexity is usefully differentiated from the concepts of size, ignorance, variety, minimum description length and order.

Compared to other auction mechanisms, they often increase the efficiency of the auction, while keeping low risks for bidders. However, the determination of an optimal winner combination in combinatorial auctions is a complex computational problem.

Load speculation techniques have been proposed to reduce this latency. Dependence Predictioncan be used to allow loads to be issued before all prior store addresses are known, and to predict exactly which store a load should wait upon. Address Predictioncan be used to allow a load to bypass the calculation of its effective address and speculatively issue. Value Predictioncan be used to bypass the load forward latency and avoid cache misses. Memory Renaminghas been proposed to communicate stored values directly to aliased loads. In this paper we examine in detail the interaction and performance tradeoffs of these four load speculation techniques in the presence of two mispeculation recovery architectures ‐ reexecution and squash. We examine the performance of combining these techniques to create a load speculation chooser which provides performance improvement over using any one technique in isolation.

The framework is intended to be coordinated with a dynamic compositional semantics. Accordingly, the context of utterance is modeled as a tuple of different types of information, and the questions therein — modeled, as is usual in formal semantics, as alternative sets of propositions — constrain the felicitous flow of discourse. A requirement of Relevance is satisfied by an utterance (whether an assertion, a question or a suggestion) iff it addresses the question under discussion. Finally, it is argued that the prosodic focus of an utterance canonically serves to reflect the question under discussion (at least in English), placing additional constraints on felicity in context.

These high-level shape primitives allow knit objects to be scheduled, scaled, and otherwise shaped in ways that require thousands of edits to low-level instructions. At the core of our compiler is a heuristic transfer planning algorithm for knit cycles, which we prove is both sound and complete. This algorithm enables the translation of high-level shaping and scheduling operations into needle-level operations.

A compiler typically divides a program into multiple regions of code and then schedules each region. Many past efforts have focused on linear regions such as traces and superblocks. The linearity of these regions can limit speculation, leading to under-utilization of processor resources, especially on wide-issue machines. A type of non-linear region called a treegion is presented in this paper. The formation and scheduling of treegions takes into account multiple execution paths, and the larger scope of treegions allows more speculation, leading to higher utilization and better performance. Multiple scheduling heuristics for treegions are compared against scheduling for several types of linear regions. Empirical results illustrate that instruction scheduling using treegions treegion scheduling-holds promise. Treegion scheduling using the global weight heuristic outperforms the next highest performing region-superblocks by up to 20%.",Computer Science,3,0,instruction scheduling one important phase compilation highperformance processor compiler typically divide program multiple region code schedule region many past effort focused linear region trace superblocks linearity region limit speculation leading underutilization processor resource especially wideissue machine type nonlinear region called treegion presented paper formation scheduling treegions take account multiple execution path larger scope treegions allows speculation leading higher utilization better performance multiple scheduling heuristic treegions compared scheduling several type linear region empirical result illustrate instruction scheduling using treegions treegion schedulingholds promise treegion scheduling using global weight heuristic outperforms next highest performing regionsuperblocks

Prior work has established this strategy to be especially beneficial for dynamic languages such as JavaScript, where the TJIT interfaces with the interpreter and produces machine code from the JavaScript trace. This direct coupling with a JavaScript interpreter makes it difficult to harness the power of a TJIT for other components that are not written in JavaScript, e.g., the DOM implementation or the layout engine inside a browser. Furthermore, if a TJIT is tied to a particular high-level language interpreter, it is difficult to reuse it for other input languages as the optimizations are likely targeted at specific idioms of the source language. To address these issues, we designed and implemented a TJIT for Microsoft's Common Intermediate Language CIL (the target language of C#, VisualBasic, F#, and many other languages). Working on CIL enables TJIT optimizations for any program compiled to this platform. In addition, to validate that the performance gains of a TJIT for JavaScript do not depend on specific idioms of JavaScript that are lost in the translation to CIL, we provide a performance evaluation of our JavaScript runtime which translates JavaScript to CIL and then runs on top of our CIL TJIT.",Computer Science,4,0,tracing justintime compiler tjits determine frequently executed trace hot path loop running program focus optimization effort emitting optimized machine code specialized trace prior work established strategy especially beneficial dynamic language javascript tjit interface interpreter produce machine code javascript trace direct coupling javascript interpreter make difficult harness power tjit component written javascript eg dom implementation layout engine inside browser furthermore tjit tied particular highlevel language interpreter difficult reuse input language optimization likely targeted specific idiom source language address issue designed implemented tjit microsofts common intermediate language cil target language c visualbasic f many language working cil enables tjit optimization program compiled platform addition validate performance gain tjit javascript depend specific idiom javascript lost translation cil provide performance evaluation javascript runtime translates javascript cil run top cil tjit

The minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of G is the total domination number γt(G) of G. It is known [J Graph Theory 35 (2000), 21–45] that if G is a connected graph of order n > 10 with minimum degree at least 2, then γt(G) ≤ 4n/7 and the (infinite family of) graphs of large order that achieve equality in this bound are characterized. In this article, we improve this upper bound of 4n/7 for 2‐connected graphs, as well as for connected graphs with no induced 6‐cycle. We prove that if G is a 2‐connected graph of order n > 18, then γt(G) ≤ 6n/11. Our proof is an interplay between graph theory and transversals in hypergraphs. We also prove that if G is a connected graph of order n > 18 with minimum degree at least 2 and no induced 6‐cycle, then γt(G) ≤ 6n/11.

The first supplies algorithms with a high degree of freedom, without increasing the number of physical channels. The second methodology is intended for the design of fault-tolerant algorithms. Some examples are given to show the application of the methodologies. Simulations show the performance improvement that can be achieved by designing the routing algorithms with the new theory. >",Computer Science,3,0,theoretical background design deadlockfree adaptive routing algorithm wormhole network developed author proposes basic definition two theorem create condition verify adaptive algorithm deadlockfree even cycle channel dependency graph two design methodology also proposed first supply algorithm high degree freedom without increasing number physical channel second methodology intended design faulttolerant algorithm example given show application methodology simulation show performance improvement achieved designing routing algorithm new theory

So far, there is no formal correctness criterion for secure compilers that comes with a clear understanding of what security properties the criterion actually provides. Ideally, we would like a criterion that, if fulfilled by a compiler, guarantees that large classes of security properties of source language programs continue to hold in the compiled program, even as the compiled program is run against adversaries with low-level attack capabilities. This paper provides such a novel correctness criterion for secure compilers, called trace-preserving compilation (TPC). We show that TPC preserves a large class of security properties, namely all safety hyperproperties. Further, we show that TPC preserves more properties than full abstraction, the de-facto criterion used for secure compilation. Then, we show that several fully abstract compilers described in literature satisfy an additional, common property, which implies that they also satisfy TPC. As an illustration, we prove that a fully abstract compiler from a typed source language to an untyped target language satisfies TPC.",Computer Science,4,0,area secure compilation aim design compiler produce hardened code withstand attack lowlevel colinked component far formal correctness criterion secure compiler come clear understanding security property criterion actually provides ideally would like criterion fulfilled compiler guarantee large class security property source language program continue hold compiled program even compiled program run adversary lowlevel attack capability paper provides novel correctness criterion secure compiler called tracepreserving compilation tpc show tpc preserve large class security property namely safety hyperproperties show tpc preserve property full abstraction defacto criterion used secure compilation show several fully abstract compiler described literature satisfy additional common property implies also satisfy tpc illustration prove fully abstract compiler typed source language untyped target language satisfies tpc

Variables and chains are two of the most important features of DGL, and also two of the trickiest features to implement. The run‐time dictionaires, which are built into the C code generated by the compiler, are implemented as pure code rather than as table‐look‐up routines.

Solutions have consisted of finding plausible (or implausible) behavioral assumptions that effectively eliminate the uncertainty.

In this paper, we analyze a simple game called the ""chopstick auction"" in which bidders are confronted with the exposure problem. We do so both in theory and in a laboratory experiment. In theory, the chopstick auction has an efficient equilibrium and is revenue equivalent with the second-price sealed-bid auction in which the exposure problem is not present. In the experiment, however, we find that the chopstick auction is less efficient than the second-price sealed-bid auction and that it yields more [the same] revenue if bidders are inexperienced [experienced].",Economics,2,0,multiunit auction sometimes plagued socalled exposure problem paper analyze simple game called chopstick auction bidder confronted exposure problem theory laboratory experiment theory chopstick auction efficient equilibrium revenue equivalent secondprice sealedbid auction exposure problem present experiment however find chopstick auction le efficient secondprice sealedbid auction yield revenue bidder inexperienced experienced

The analysis shows that when an airport is dominated by a monopolist, congestion is fully internalized, yielding no role for congestion pricing under monopoly conditions.

Although the main principles of the theory of second best have undoubtedly gained wide acceptance, no general statement of them seems to exist. Furthermore, the principles often seem to be forgotten in the context of specific problems and, when they are rediscovered and stated in the form pertinent to some problem, this seems to evoke expressions of surprise and doubt rather than of immediate agreement and satisfaction at the discovery of yet another application of the already accepted generalizations.",Economics,3,0,important basic similarity underlying number recent work apparently widely separated field economic theory upon examination would appear author rediscovering many guise given various specific problem single general theorem theorem form core may called general theory second best although main principle theory second best undoubtedly gained wide acceptance general statement seems exist furthermore principle often seem forgotten context specific problem rediscovered stated form pertinent problem seems evoke expression surprise doubt rather immediate agreement satisfaction discovery yet another application already accepted generalization

711,ec4a8750c171f705757c467dcd1d6c30a8f9e22d,On the Impossibility of Core-Selecting Auctions,"When goods are substitutes, the Vickrey auction produces efficient, core outcomes that yield competitive seller revenues. In contrast, with complements, the Vickrey outcome, while efficient, is not necessarily in the core and revenue can be very low. Non-core outcomes may be perceived as unfair since there are bidders willing to pay more than the winners' payments. Moreover, non-core outcomes render the auction vulnerable to defections as the seller can attract better offers afterwards. To avoid instabilities of this type, Day and Raghavan (2007) and Day and Milgrom (2007) have suggested to adapt the Vickrey pricing rule. For a simple environment with private information, we show that the resulting auction format yields lower than Vickrey revenues and inefficient outcomes that are on average further from the core than Vickrey outcomes. More generally, we prove that the Vickrey auction is the unique core-selecting auction. Hence, when the Vickrey outcome is not in the core, no Bayesian incentive-compatible core-selecting auction exists. Our results further imply that the competitive equilibrium cannot be implemented when goods are not substitutes. Moreover, even with substitutes, the competitive equilibrium can only be implemented when it coincides with the Vickrey outcome.",Economics,2,0,good substitute vickrey auction produce efficient core outcome yield competitive seller revenue contrast complement vickrey outcome efficient necessarily core revenue low noncore outcome may perceived unfair since bidder willing pay winner payment moreover noncore outcome render auction vulnerable defection seller attract better offer afterwards avoid instability type day raghavan day milgrom suggested adapt vickrey pricing rule simple environment private information show resulting auction format yield lower vickrey revenue inefficient outcome average core vickrey outcome generally prove vickrey auction unique coreselecting auction hence vickrey outcome core bayesian incentivecompatible coreselecting auction exists result imply competitive equilibrium implemented good substitute moreover even substitute competitive equilibrium implemented coincides vickrey outcome

In the short term, however, anecdotal evidence indicates that gentrification actually increases crime, perhaps due to the relative difference in status between newcomers and existing residents, and to increased opportunities for criminal behavior. Further, consumers’ choice of residential location depends on crime rates, creating simultaneity that likely biases estimates that overlook this concern. I exploit the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles and subsequent short-term government-sponsored home financing incentives as an instrument to control for this endogeneity. The exogenous event induced middle- and upper-income individuals to purchase homes in earthquake-affected low and moderate-income neighborhoods, which I argue is independent of the influence of crime. The results show that in the short term, gentrification increases assaults, robberies, automobile thefts, and thefts from automobiles.",Economics,4,0,abstract theory suggests long term gentrificationwhich define phenomenon wealthier individual move lowerincome areasshould decrease neighborhood crime short term however anecdotal evidence indicates gentrification actually increase crime perhaps due relative difference status newcomer existing resident increased opportunity criminal behavior consumer choice residential location depends crime rate creating simultaneity likely bias estimate overlook concern exploit northridge earthquake los angeles subsequent shortterm governmentsponsored home financing incentive instrument control endogeneity exogenous event induced middle upperincome individual purchase home earthquakeaffected low moderateincome neighborhood argue independent influence crime result show short term gentrification increase assault robbery automobile theft theft automobile

Unfortunately, numerous high-stakes disputes have recently broken out over just what these “FRAND commitments” mean and how and where to enforce them. We propose a simple, practical set of rules regarding patents that SSOs can adopt to achieve the goals of FRAND commitments far more efficiently with far less litigation. Under our proposed approach, if an standard-essential patent owner and an implementer of the standard cannot agree on licensing terms, the standard-essential patent owner is obligated to enter into binding baseball-style (or “final offer”) arbitration with any willing licensee to determine the royalty rate. This obligation may be conditioned on the implementer making a reciprocal FRAND Commitment for any standard-essential patents it owns that read on the same standard. If the implementer is unwilling to enter into binding arbitration, the standard-essential patent owner’s FRAND commitment not to go to court to enforce its standard-essential patents against that party is discharged. We explain how our proposed FRAND regime would work in practice. Many of the disputes currently arising around FRAND commitments become moot under our approach.",Economics,4,0,standard setting organization ssos typically require member license standardessential patent fair reasonable nondiscriminatory frand term unfortunately numerous highstakes dispute recently broken frand commitment mean enforce propose simple practical set rule regarding patent ssos adopt achieve goal frand commitment far efficiently far le litigation proposed approach standardessential patent owner implementer standard agree licensing term standardessential patent owner obligated enter binding baseballstyle final offer arbitration willing licensee determine royalty rate obligation may conditioned implementer making reciprocal frand commitment standardessential patent owns read standard implementer unwilling enter binding arbitration standardessential patent owner frand commitment go court enforce standardessential patent party discharged explain proposed frand regime would work practice many dispute currently arising around frand commitment become moot approach

Whenever this is forgotten, as happens in the so-called neoclassical synthesis, not only the original Keynesian spirit goes lost but also, and especially, we lose substantive bricks for our theoretical constructions. The paper considers an important instance of this general rule; namely Keynes's views on the logic of probability, meant as the field concerning human behaviour in an uncertain world (hence connected to, but distinct from, the pure theory of probability, meant as a field of mathematics). The paper begins by recalling the main aspects of the classical and frequentist approaches to probability and the main criticisms they received, pertaining among other things to the limits of their applicability. We then consider Keynes's own views, stressing three aspects: the definition of probability as pertaining to the field of logic, the notion of uncertainty and of the ‘weight of the argument’, the ‘theory of groups’. We then discuss the subjective approach of de Finetti, Ramsey and Savage, and contrast it with Keynes's own views. Finally, we consider the implications of our analysis for the interpretation of Keynes's General Theory, and of his attitude towards econometrics.",Economics,4,0,abstract interpreter agree keynes wideranging complex vision world underlies theoretical contribution whenever forgotten happens socalled neoclassical synthesis original keynesian spirit go lost also especially lose substantive brick theoretical construction paper considers important instance general rule namely keynes view logic probability meant field concerning human behaviour uncertain world hence connected distinct pure theory probability meant field mathematics paper begin recalling main aspect classical frequentist approach probability main criticism received pertaining among thing limit applicability consider keynes view stressing three aspect definition probability pertaining field logic notion uncertainty weight argument theory group discus subjective approach de finetti ramsey savage contrast keynes view finally consider implication analysis interpretation keynes general theory attitude towards econometrics

We find that equilibrium bidding is more aggressive than standard predictions. Indeed, in second-price auctions it is optimal to bid above one's valuation; that is, bidding ""frenzies"" can arise in equilibrium. Further, revenue equivalence between second-price and first-price auctions breaks down, with second-price outperforming first-price. We also find that strategic equivalence between second-price and English auctions no longer holds, although they remain revenue equivalent. We conclude that spiteful bidding rationalizes anomalies observed in laboratory experiments across the four auction forms better than the leading alternatives.",Economics,3,0,abstract study auction bidder independent private value attach disutility surplus rival derive symmetric equilibrium firstprice secondprice english dutch auction find equilibrium bidding aggressive standard prediction indeed secondprice auction optimal bid one valuation bidding frenzy arise equilibrium revenue equivalence secondprice firstprice auction break secondprice outperforming firstprice also find strategic equivalence secondprice english auction longer hold although remain revenue equivalent conclude spiteful bidding rationalizes anomaly observed laboratory experiment across four auction form better leading alternative

Buyer i's preferences are characterized by an N-dimensional vector t^i = (t1^i, t2^i,..,tN^i). The coordinate ti^i can be interpreted as the usual ""private value"" of player i, while each other coordinate tj^i represents i's total payoff should j get the object. In this framework, we characterize incentive-compatible and individually-rational mechanisms, and look at second price auctions (which, under some conditions, maximize the seller's revenue). Any incentive combatible mechanism induces a conditional probability assignement vector field which is conservative. A useful geometric property of conservative vector fields is used for the derivation of a differential equation which determines equilibrium bids. Finally, we show that exclusion (i.e., the announcement of a reservation price such that a measure can never get the object) is not necessarilly optimal for the seller. This contrasts with Armstrong's (Econometrica, 1995) insight about the optimality of exclusion in another multidimensional setting.",Economics,4,0,framework buyer obtain auctioned object longer indifferent identity winner ie eyternal effect present buyer preference characterized ndimensional vector ti ti titni coordinate tii interpreted usual private value player coordinate tji represents total payoff j get object framework characterize incentivecompatible individuallyrational mechanism look second price auction condition maximize seller revenue incentive combatible mechanism induces conditional probability assignement vector field conservative useful geometric property conservative vector field used derivation differential equation determines equilibrium bid finally show exclusion ie announcement reservation price measure never get object necessarilly optimal seller contrast armstrong econometrica insight optimality exclusion another multidimensional setting

We avoid these problems by considering limits of ever finer finite bid sets such that no two bidders have a common serious bid, and by recalling that single crossing is needed only at individually rational bids.

Understanding the Importance of Bitcoin in Cryptocurrency Returns,The cryptocurrency literature has attempted to identifying factors that explain excess returns. We utilise principal component analysis to determine whether a (small) set of factors can explain returns and whether this varies over time. We find that a substantial proportion of cryptocurrency return variation is explained by a single principal component that is highly correlated with bitcoin returns. The explanatory power of this factor is greatest for larger cryptocurrencies and increases markedly in the most recent part of the sample. Our results have implications for investors determining optimal portfolio decisions and for policymakers wary of systemic risk.,Economics,2,0,cryptocurrency literature attempted identifying factor explain excess return utilise principal component analysis determine whether small set factor explain return whether varies time find substantial proportion cryptocurrency return variation explained single principal component highly correlated bitcoin return explanatory power factor greatest larger cryptocurrencies increase markedly recent part sample result implication investor determining optimal portfolio decision policymakers wary systemic risk

In the proxy auction (revelation game) versions, the outcome is a point in the core of the exchange economy for the reported preferences. When payoffs are linear in money and goods are substitutes, sincere reporting constitutes a Nash equilibrium and the outcome coincides with the Vickrey auction outcome. Even when goods are not substitutes, ascending proxy auction equilibria lie in the core with respect to the true preferences. Compared to the Vickrey auction, the proxy auctions generate higher equilibrium revenues, are less vulnerable to shill bidding and collusion, can handle budget constraints much more robustly, and may provide better ex ante investment incentives.",Economics,4,0,abstract family ascending package auction model introduced bidder may determine package bid proxy auction revelation game version outcome point core exchange economy reported preference payoff linear money good substitute sincere reporting constitutes nash equilibrium outcome coincides vickrey auction outcome even good substitute ascending proxy auction equilibrium lie core respect true preference compared vickrey auction proxy auction generate higher equilibrium revenue le vulnerable shill bidding collusion handle budget constraint much robustly may provide better ex ante investment incentive

This theory is based on an analysis of the interrelationships of the various coalitions which can be formed by the players of the game. Our theory, in contradistinction, is based on the absence of coalitions in that it is assumed that each participant acts independently, without collaboration or communication with any of the others. The notion of an equilibrium point is the basic ingredient in our theory. This notion yields a generalization of the concept of the solution of a two-person zerosum game. It turns out that the set of equilibrium points of a two-person zerosum game is simply the set of all pairs of opposing ""good strategies."" In the immediately following sections we shall define equilibrium points and prove that a finite non-cooperative game always has at least one equilibrium point. We shall also introduce the notions of solvability and strong solvability of a non-cooperative game and prove a theorem on the geometrical structure of the set of equilibrium points of a solvable game.

At the same time, the Carnot cycle model developed by the author predicts that the central pressure of mature cyclones is independent of the magnitude of the exchange coefficients. The author presents numerical simulations that prove this last prediction false and suggest that the reason for this failure is the neglect of eye dynamics in the steady-state theory. On this basis, the existing theory is modified to account for eye dynamics, and the predictions of the revised theory are compared to the results of numerical simulations.

We define V as the infimum of areas of nontrivial holomorphic spheroids S ⊂ M. So V = ∞ if M is aspherical and, for example, V = 1 if M = S (more general, if M = CP ). Let ‖f(z, u)‖u < √ V where ‖ · ‖u stands for the normalized Kählerian metric. Then, first, the equation has at least |χ(M)| contractible solutions (χ(M) is the Euler characteristic) if f is taken from an open dense subset of the set of all admissible f and, second, for each admissible f it has at least one solution if χ(M) 6= 0.

The book aims to give the reader an understanding of the interrelationships of the three basic theories of physics. The first two chapters give the necessary mathematical background in differential geometry, Lie groups, and symplectic geometry. In chapter three a symplectic description of Galilean and relativistic mechanics is given, culminating in the classification of elementary particles (relativistic and non-relativistic, with or without spin, with or without mass). In the fourth chapter statistic mechanics is put into symplectic form, finishing with a symplectic description of the kinetic theory of gases and the computation of specific heats. The final chapter covers the author's theory of geometric quantization, and included in this chapter are the derivations of the various wave equations, and the construction of the Fock space.

The problem of determining conditions under which Tx + T2 is maximal turns out to be of fundamental importance in the theory of monotone operators.

The argument proceeds as follows: (1) The following postulates are assumed: (a) there exists an upper bound on the speed of signals; (b) there exists an upper bound on the density with which information can be stored. (2) Automata of fixed, finite size can recognize, at best, only iteratively defined classes of input sequences. (3) Recursively defined classes of input sequences that cannot be defined iteratively can be recognized only by automata of unbounded size. (4) in order for an automaton to solve a (soluble) recursive problem, the possibility must be granted that it can be extended unboundedly in whatever way might be required. (5) Automata (as actual hardware) formulated in accordance with automata theory will, after a finite number of extensions, conflict with at least one of the postulates. Suitable conceptual structures for an exact theory of communication are then discussed, and a theory of communication proposed.",Mathematics,3,0,abstract theory automaton shown capable representing actual physical flow information solution recursive problem argument proceeds follows following postulate assumed exists upper bound speed signal b exists upper bound density information stored automaton fixed finite size recognize best iteratively defined class input sequence recursively defined class input sequence defined iteratively recognized automaton unbounded size order automaton solve soluble recursive problem possibility must granted extended unboundedly whatever way might required automaton actual hardware formulated accordance automaton theory finite number extension conflict least one postulate suitable conceptual structure exact theory communication discussed theory communication proposed

It was conjectured that the laws of this commutative algebra would form a suitable starting point for a generalization of the present quantum mechanical theory. The need of such a generalization arises from the (probably) fundamental difficulties resulting when one attempts to apply quantum mechanics to questions in relativistic and nuclear phenomena.,Mathematics,3,0,one u shown statistical property measurement quantum mechanical system assume simplest form expressed term certain hypercomplex algebra commutative associative algebra differs noncommutative associative matrix algebra usually considered one concerned commutative expression b b instead associative product b two matrix conjectured law commutative algebra would form suitable starting point generalization present quantum mechanical theory need generalization arises probably fundamental difficulty resulting one attempt apply quantum mechanic question relativistic nuclear phenomenon

Algorithmic complexity says an object x has a complexity K(x) equal to the length of the shortest (binary) program that describes x. It is a beautiful fact that these ideas are much the same. In fact, it is roughly true that EK(X) - H. Moreover, if we let Pu(x) = Pr{U prints x} be the probability that a given computer U prints x when given a random program, it can be shown that log(1/Pu(x)) - K(x) for all x, thus establishing a vital link between the "" universal"" probability measure Pu and the "" universal"" complexity K.

Through the recent ""categorifications"" of cluster algebras using representation theory one obtains a whole variety of exchange graphs associated with objects such as a finite-dimensional algebra or a differential graded algebra concentrated in non-positive degrees. These constructions often come from variations of the concept of tilting, the vertices of the exchange graph being torsion pairs, t-structures, silting objects, support $\tau$-tilting modules and so on. All these exchange graphs stemming from representation theory have the additional feature that they are the Hasse quiver of a partial order which is naturally defined for the objects. In this sense, the exchange graphs studied in this article can be considered as a generalization or as a completion of the poset of tilting modules which has been studied by Happel and Unger. The goal of this article is to axiomatize the thus obtained structure of an ordered exchange graph, to present the various constructions of ordered exchange graphs and to relate them among each other.",Mathematics,4,0,exchange graph cluster algebra encodes combinatorics mutation cluster recent categorifications cluster algebra using representation theory one obtains whole variety exchange graph associated object finitedimensional algebra differential graded algebra concentrated nonpositive degree construction often come variation concept tilting vertex exchange graph torsion pair tstructures silting object support tautilting module exchange graph stemming representation theory additional feature hasse quiver partial order naturally defined object sense exchange graph studied article considered generalization completion poset tilting module studied happel unger goal article axiomatize thus obtained structure ordered exchange graph present various construction ordered exchange graph relate among

The latter is where geometry got its name (Greek: geo""earth"", -metron ""measurement""). The geometry we know today, also known as Euclidean geometry is derived from the axiomatic formulation put forward by Euclid around 300 B.C. In this formulation Euclid put forward five postulates, which if assumed true, give rise to all the geometry we learned through middle and high-school. The postulates may seem very natural and at times even trivial, yet they cannot be derived logically from any reduced set of assumptions.

In this paper an analogous difference operator is studied for an arbitrary graph. It is shown that many properties of the Laplacian in the continuous setting (e.g. the maximum principle, the Harnack inequality, and Cheeger's bound for the lowest eigenvalue) hold for this difference oper- ator. The difference Laplacian governs the random walk on a graph, just as the Laplace operator governs the Brownian motion. As an application of the theory of the difference Laplacian, it is shown that the random walk on a class of graphs is transient. The random walks we consider are defined as follows. Let K be a connected graph (i.e. a one dimensional simplicial complex). For a vertex x E K, let m(x) denote the number of edges emanating from x. The probability that a particle moves from x to another vertex y E K is l/m(x) if x and y are connected by an edge and it is zero otherwise.

It turns out that the Hamiltonian dynamics which is induced from fictitious play, has properties which are rather different from those found in more classically defined Hamiltonian dynamics. Although the vectorfield is piecewise constant (and so the flow $\phi_t$ piecewise a translation), the dynamics is rather rich. For example, there exists a Hamilton $H$ so that for each $t>0$ the level set $H^{-1}(t)$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$ (the level sets consist of pieces of hyperplanes in $\R^4$) and with the following property. There exists a periodic orbit $\Gamma$ of the Hamiltonian flow in $H^{-1}(1)$ so that the first return map $F$ to a section $Z\subset H^{-1}(1)$ transversal to $\Gamma$ at $x\in \Gamma$ acts as a random-walk: there exist a nested sequence of annuli $A_n$ in $Z$ (around $x$ so that $\cup A_n\cup \{x\}$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $Z$) shrinking geometrically to $x$ so that for each sequence $n(i)\ge 0$ with $|n(i+1)-n(i)|\le 1$ there exists a point $z\in Z$ so that $F^i(z)\in A_{n(i)}$ for all $i\ge 0$.",Mathematics,2,0,paper relate dynamic associated zerosum game fictitious play hamiltonian dynamic turn hamiltonian dynamic induced fictitious play property rather different found classically defined hamiltonian dynamic although vectorfield piecewise constant flow phit piecewise translation dynamic rather rich example exists hamilton h level set ht homeomorphic level set consist piece hyperplanes r following property exists periodic orbit gamma hamiltonian flow h first return map f section zsubset h transversal gamma xin gamma act randomwalk exist nested sequence annulus z around x cup ancup x neighbourhood x z shrinking geometrically x sequence nige ninile exists point zin z fizin ani ige

In particular, it shows that a rank-dependent preference functional is obtained in this set-up when the independence axiom is weakened to stochastic dominance and a probability trade-off consistency condition. In contrast with the existing axiomatizations of rank-dependent utility, the resulting axioms allow for complete flexibility regarding the outcome space. Consequently, a parameter-free test/elicitation of rank-dependent utility becomes possible. The probability-oriented approach of this paper also provides theoretical foundations for probabilistic attitudes towards risk. It is shown that the preference conditions that characterize the shape of the probability weighting function can be derived from simple probability trade-off conditions.

To stress the relationship between both theorems, a common approach is given to their proof, consisting of bringing the system to a normal form constructed through the Lie series method. The estimates obtained for the size of the remainder rely on bounds of the associated vectorfields, allowing one to get the “optimal” stability exponent in Nekhoroshev theorem for quasiconvex systems.

It is the superposition of the Arab science of the lightening calculation of the solutions of equations over the Greek art of position and shape.

Algebraic geometry studies the delicate balance between the geometrically plausible and the algebraic possible.

A special case of a theorem of Ramsey can be stated in graph theoretic language as follows: There exists a function f(k, I) of positive integers k, I with the following property. Let there be given a graph G of n*zf(kf I) vertices. Then either G contains a complete graph of order fe, or G' a complete graph of order L (A complete graph is a graph any two vertices of which are connected.

These conditions are derived from the connectivity graph, which describes how the oscillators are connected. In particular, we show how such a sufficient condition is dependent on the algebraic connectivity of the connectivity graph. Intuition tells us that if the oscillators are more ""closely connected"" to each other, then they are more likely to synchronize. We discuss how to quantify connectedness in graph-theoretical terms and its relation to algebraic connectivity and show that our results are in accordance with this intuition. We also give an upper bound on the coupling conductance required for synchronization for arbitrary graphs, which is in the order of n/sup 2/, where n is the number of oscillators. >",Mathematics,1,0,letter show algebraic graph theory used derive sufficient condition array resistively coupled nonlinear oscillator synchronize condition derived connectivity graph describes oscillator connected particular show sufficient condition dependent algebraic connectivity connectivity graph intuition tell u oscillator closely connected likely synchronize discus quantify connectedness graphtheoretical term relation algebraic connectivity show result accordance intuition also give upper bound coupling conductance required synchronization arbitrary graph order nsup n number oscillator

IntroductionIt is well known that Levi–Malcev theorem is valid for Lie algebras and Malcevalgebras. But it is not valid for binary-Lie algebras (in classical sense) as wellas for Bol algebras. Since the Levi–Malcev theorem plays the basic role instructural theories, it is useful to get some generalized version of such a theoremfor Bol algebras. In this report the problem for so-called homogeneous Bolalgebras with some examples will be discussed.Let us note that the problem is important in applications to Diﬀerentialgeometry and Smooth Quasigroups and Loops theory (because that Bol algebrais the proper inﬁnitesimal object for a smooth Bol loop, and any symmetricspace, for example, is a smooth Bol loop).It is also noted that, Bol loops and Bol algebras are signiﬁcant in Mathe-matical Physics (chiral anomalies etc.).Remark: The smooth Bol loops-Bol algebras theory is due to L.V.

However, in deference to some recent attempts to unify the terminology of graph theory we replace the term 'circuit' by 'polygon', and 'degree' by 'valency'. A graph G is 3-connected (nodally 3-connected) if it is simple and non-separable and satisfies the following condition; if G is the union of two proper subgraphs H and K such that HnK consists solely of two vertices u and v, then one of H and K is a link-graph (arc-graph) with ends u and v. It should be noted that the union of two proper subgraphs H and K of G can be the whole of G only if each of H and K includes at least one edge or vertex not belonging to the other. In this paper we are concerned mainly with nodally 3-connected graphs, but a specialization to 3-connected graphs is made in § 12. In § 3 we discuss conditions for a nodally 3-connected graph to be planar, and in § 5 we discuss conditions for the existence of Kuratowski subgraphs of a given graph.

Definition 1. A problem is a problem I cannot solve, not necessarily an unsolved problem. 1. Sums and differences For any set A of integers, we define the sumset A + A = {a + a : a, a ∈ A} and the difference set A − A = {a− a : a, a ∈ A}. In this section we consider finite sets of integers, and the relative sizes of their sumsets and difference sets. If A is a finite set of integers and x, y ∈ Z, then the translation of A by x is the set x + A = {x + a : a ∈ A} and the dilation of A by y is y ∗ A = {ya : a ∈ A}. We have (x + A) + (x + A) = 2x + 2A and (x + A) − (x + A) = A − A. Similarly, y ∗ A + y ∗ A = y ∗ (A + A) and y ∗ A − y ∗ A = y ∗ (A − A). It follows that |(x + y ∗ A) + (x + y ∗ A)| = |2A| and |(x + y ∗ A) − (x + y ∗ A)| = |A − A| so the cardinalities of the sum and difference sets of a finite set of integers are invariant under affine transformations of the set. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11B05, 11B13, 11B34.",Mathematics,0,0,talk atelier en combinatoire additive workshop arithmetic combinatorics centre de recherches mathématiques université de montréal april definition problem problem solve necessarily unsolved problem sum difference set integer define sumset difference set section consider finite set integer relative size sumsets difference set finite set integer x z translation x set x x dilation ya x x x x x similarly follows x x x x cardinality sum difference set finite set integer invariant affine transformation set mathematics subject classification b b b

Similarity also exists for the multidimensional case, and this is helpful in the design of difference approximations. In this paper high-order essentially nonoscillatory (ENO) schemes for H–J equations are investigated, which yield uniform high-order accuracy in smooth regions and sharply resolve discontinuities in the derivatives. The ENO scheme construction procedure is adapted from that for hyperbolic conservation laws.

1066,520b4ad8c20163d09f0d3d93564a969705e83e4c,Spectral asymmetry and Riemannian Geometry. I,"1. Introduction. The main purpose of this paper is to present a generalization of Hirzebruch's signature theorem for the case of manifolds with boundary. Our result is in the framework of Riemannian geometry and can be viewed as analogous to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for manifolds with boundary, although there is a very significant difference between the two cases which is, in a sense, the central topic of the paper. To explain this difference let us begin by recalling that the classical Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a surface X with boundary Y asserts that the Euler characteristic E(X) is given by a formula: where K is the Gauss curvature of X and σ is the geodesic curvature of Y in X. In particular if, near the boundary, X is isometric to the product Y x R+, the boundary integral in (1.1) vanishes and the formula is the same as for closed surfaces. Similar remarks hold in higher dimensions. Now if X is a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension 4, there is another formula relating cohomological invariants with curvature in addition to the Gauss–Bonnet formula. This expresses the signature of the quadratic form on H2(X, R) by an integral formula where p1 is the differential 4-form representing the first Pontrjagin class and is given in terms of the curvature matrix R by p1 = (2π)−2Tr R2. It is natural to ask if (1.2) continues to hold for manifolds with boundary, provided the metric is a product near the boundary. Simple examples show that this is false, so that in general",Mathematics,4,0,introduction main purpose paper present generalization hirzebruchs signature theorem case manifold boundary result framework riemannian geometry viewed analogous gaussbonnet theorem manifold boundary although significant difference two case sense central topic paper explain difference let u begin recalling classical gaussbonnet theorem surface x boundary asserts euler characteristic ex given formula k gauss curvature x σ geodesic curvature x particular near boundary x isometric product x r boundary integral vanishes formula closed surface similar remark hold higher dimension x closed oriented riemannian manifold dimension another formula relating cohomological invariant curvature addition gaussbonnet formula express signature quadratic form hx r integral formula p differential form representing first pontrjagin class given term curvature matrix r p πtr r natural ask continues hold manifold boundary provided metric product near boundary simple example show false general

Franks and Guckenheimer have worked on the diffeomorphism problem by strengthening the definition of fl-stable diffeomorphisms. In this paper it will be shown that an analogous strengthening of Q2-stable vectorfields forces Smale's conditions to be necessary. The major result of this paper is the following THEOREM.

A search of the literature seemed to indicate that various theorems had been conjectured but none actually proved.f For example, L. Euler stated without proof that every integer of the form 47+2 is a sum of two primes each of the form 47 + 1. Even the weaker statement that every integer of the form 4/+2 is a sum of two integers which have all their prime factors of the form 4/+1 has not yet been proved. In view of the absence of any definite results in the literature it seems worthwhile to point out that some very interesting theorems can be obtained in an elementary way.

To be more precise, assume that the sectional curvature K of M satisfies — b<K< — a, where 0 < a < oo and 0 < & < o o . I f p e M and z is a point at infinity (cf. EberleinO'Neill [4], which we give as a general reference for Hadamard manifolds), there exists a horosphere through p with center z. This is defined as follows: Denote the geodesic ray from p to z by γ, and consider the geodesic spheres through p with center γ(t), t > 0. As t goes to infinity, these spheres converge to the horosphere. More precisely, the horospheres are the level surfaces of the Busemann function F = limFt, where Ft is defined by Ft(p) = d(p, γ(t)) — t. In the flat case (a = b = 0), horospheres are just affine hyperplanes, and in the case of constant negative curvature, using the Poincare model we see that horospheres are euclidean spheres internally tangent to the boundary sphere, minus the point of tangency. The main purpose of this paper is to show that, to a certain extent, the geometry of horospheres in M may be compared with that in the spaces of constant curvature — a and — b, respectively.

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.",Mathematics,4,0,argued underlying churchturing hypothesis implicit physical assertion assertion presented explicitly physical principle every finitely realizible physical system perfectly simulated universal model computing machine operating finite mean classical physic universal turing machine former continuous latter discrete obey principle least strong form class model computing machine quantum generalization class turing machine described shown quantum theory universal quantum computer compatible principle computing machine resembling universal quantum computer could principle built would many remarkable property reproducible turing machine include computation nonrecursive function include quantum parallelism method certain probabilistic task performed faster universal quantum computer classical restriction intuitive explanation property place intolerable strain interpretation quantum theory everetts numerous connection quantum theory computation rest physic explored quantum complexity theory allows physically reasonable definition complexity knowledge physical system classical complexity theory

Initially this part of perturbationtheorywasdevelopedfor conservative, i.e., Hamiltonian,systemsthat model the frictionlessdynamicsof classicalmechanics.Relatedphysicalquestionsareconcernedwith theperpetualstability of thesolarsystem,of tokamakaccelerators, etc. Initiatedby Poincaŕe at the end of the 19th century, the theory was further developedby Birkhoff and Siegel andlater establishedby Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moserandothersfrom the 1950son. For a historicaloverview and further reference,see[36]. As pointedout in [66, 65] and later in [48, 24, 23], the conservative approach canbeextendedto many othersettings,like to generaldissipati ve systems,to volumepreservingsystemsandto variousequivariantor reversiblesettings.A unifyingLie algebraapproachenablesto reachall theseresultsatonce[66, 24]. 2 I Survey on dissipativeKAM theory In many casesthesystemsneedto dependonparametersin orderto ensurethe persistentoccurrenceof quasi-periodicity. In thegeneraldissipati ve formulation we thereforeencounterfamiliesof quasi-periodicattractors,parametrized over a nowheredensesetof positive measure.Theparametrizationis smooth in the senseof Whitney [73, 24].

In equilibrium situations, it is then often difficult to show that there are homoclinic/heteroclinic connections between these hyperbolic orbits in the original unaveraged system. This existence problem is solved in this paper for a class of Hamiltonian systems admitting a sufficient number of symmetries (including reversing symmetries). Under isoenergetic reduction, the problem is reduced to one involving reversible vector fields under time-dependent perturbations admitting the same reversing symmetries. Applications are made to the one-parameter Hénon-Heiles family. The paper concludes with remarks on the problem of showing transversality of these homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits.",Mathematics,3,0,synopsis averaging technique hamiltonian dynamical system often used establish existence hyperbolic periodic orbit equilibrium situation often difficult show homoclinicheteroclinic connection hyperbolic orbit original unaveraged system existence problem solved paper class hamiltonian system admitting sufficient number symmetry including reversing symmetry isoenergetic reduction problem reduced one involving reversible vector field timedependent perturbation admitting reversing symmetry application made oneparameter hénonheiles family paper concludes remark problem showing transversality homoclinicheteroclinic orbit

A series of oscillatory waves, such as that observed by Mr Russell, does not exactly agree with what it is most convenient, as regards theory, to take as the type of oscillatory waves. The extreme waves of such a series partake in some measure of the character of solitary waves, and their height decreases as they proceed. In fact it will presently appear that it is only an indefinite series of waves which possesses the property of being propagated with a uniform velocity, and without change of form: at least this is the case when the waves are such as can be propagated along the surface of a fluid which was previously at rest. The middle waves, however, of a series such as that observed by Mr Russell agree very nearly with oscillatory waves of the standard form. Consequently, the velocity of propagation determined by the observation of a number of waves, according to Mr Russell's method, rmist be very nearly the same as the velocity of propagation of a series of oscillatory waves of the standard form, and whose length is equal to the mean length of the waves observed, which are supposed to differ from each other but slightly in length.",Mathematics,4,0,n report fourteenth meeting british association advancement science stated mr russell result experiment velocity propagation series oscillatory wave depend height wave series oscillatory wave observed mr russell exactly agree convenient regard theory take type oscillatory wave extreme wave series partake measure character solitary wave height decrease proceed fact presently appear indefinite series wave posse property propagated uniform velocity without change form least case wave propagated along surface fluid previously rest middle wave however series observed mr russell agree nearly oscillatory wave standard form consequently velocity propagation determined observation number wave according mr russell method rmist nearly velocity propagation series oscillatory wave standard form whose length equal mean length wave observed supposed differ slightly length

First we construct addition automata for these number systems. Since [Fscr ]β defines a tiling of the n-dimensional vector space, we ask, which tiles of this tiling ‘touch’ [Fscr ]β. It turns out that the set of these tiles can be described with help of an automaton, which can be constructed via an easy algorithm which starts with the above-mentioned addition automaton.

Conformal geometries and CR geometries are examples of such structures. We present a uniform description of a calculus, called tractor calculus, based on natural bundles with canonical linear connections for all parabolic geometries. It is shown that from these bundles and connections one can recover the Cartan bundle and the Cartan connection. In particular we characterize the normal Cartan connection from this induced bundle/connection perspective. We construct explicitly a family of fundamental first order differential operators, which are analogous to a covariant derivative, iterable and defined on all natural vector bundles on parabolic geometries.

Although progress has been made in understanding the phenomenon, there still remain significant gaps, both in its fundamental theory and in numerical techniques for its characterization. In this paper, we develop a solid foundation for phase noise that is valid for any oscillator, regardless of operating mechanism. We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random. We obtain an exact nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations. This leads us to a precise characterization of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing of which we have developed efficient numerical methods. We demonstrate our techniques on a variety of practical electrical oscillators and obtain good matches with measurements, even at frequencies close to the carrier, where previous techniques break down. Our methods are more than three orders of magnitude faster than the brute-force Monte Carlo approach, which is the only previously available technique that can predict phase noise correctly.",Mathematics,4,0,phase noise topic theoretical practical interest electronic circuit well field optic although progress made understanding phenomenon still remain significant gap fundamental theory numerical technique characterization paper develop solid foundation phase noise valid oscillator regardless operating mechanism establish novel result dynamic stable nonlinear oscillator presence perturbation deterministic random obtain exact nonlinear equation phase error solve without approximation random perturbation lead u precise characterization timing jitter spectral dispersion computing developed efficient numerical method demonstrate technique variety practical electrical oscillator obtain good match measurement even frequency close carrier previous technique break method three order magnitude faster bruteforce monte carlo approach previously available technique predict phase noise correctly

It is well known that series-parallel graphs have chromatic number at most 3. Hence, their circular chromatic numbers are at most 3. If a series-parallel graph G contains a triangle, then both the chromatic number and the circular chromatic number of G are indeed equal to 3. We shall show that if a series-parallel graph G has girth at least 2 ⌊(3k - 1)-2⌋, then χc(G) ≤ 4k-(2k - 1). The special case k = 2 of this result implies that a triangle free series-parallel graph G has circular chromatic number at most 8-3. Therefore, the circular chromatic number of a series-parallel graph (and of a K4-minor free graph) is either 3 or at most 8-3. This is in sharp contrast to recent results of Moser [5] and Zhu [14], which imply that the circular chromatic number of K5-minor free graphs are precisely all rational numbers in the interval [2, 4].

It is known that any functional of Brownian motion with finite second moment can be expressed as the sum of a constant and an Ito stochastic integral. It is also known that homogeneous additive functionals of Brownian motion with finite expectations have a similar representation. This paper extends these results in several ways. It is shown that any finite functional of Brownian motion can be represented as a stochastic integral. This representation is not unique, but if the functional has a finite expectation it does have a unique representation as a constant plus a stochastic integral in which the process of indefinite integrals is a martingale. A corollary of this result is that any martingale (on a closed interval) that is measurable with respect to the increasing family of a-fields generated by a Brownian motion is equal to a constant plus an indefinite stochastic integral. Sufficiently well-behaved Frechet-differentiable functionals have an explicit representation as a stochastic integral in which the integrand has the form of conditional expectations of the differential.",Mathematics,4,0,imperial college london abstract known functional brownian motion finite second moment expressed sum constant ito stochastic integral also known homogeneous additive functionals brownian motion finite expectation similar representation paper extends result several way shown finite functional brownian motion represented stochastic integral representation unique functional finite expectation unique representation constant plus stochastic integral process indefinite integral martingale corollary result martingale closed interval measurable respect increasing family afields generated brownian motion equal constant plus indefinite stochastic integral sufficiently wellbehaved frechetdifferentiable functionals explicit representation stochastic integral integrand form conditional expectation differential

His construction and its proof are quite complicated, and the blow-up of the construction is doubly exponential. Our main result is a new determinization construction. The advantages of the construction are that it is simpler and yields a single exponent upper bound for the general case. This construction is essentially optimal. Using the construction we can also obtain an improved complementation construction for Biichi automata, which is aIso optimaI. Both constructions can be used to improve the complexity of decision procedures that use automata-theoretic techniques.",Mathematics,4,0,automaton infinite word introduced biichi order give decision procedure sl monadic secondorder theory one successor muller suggested deterministic wautomata mean describing behavior nonstabilizing circuit mcnaughton proved class language accepted nondeterministic biichi automaton deterministic muller automaton construction proof quite complicated blowup construction doubly exponential main result new determinization construction advantage construction simpler yield single exponent upper bound general case construction essentially optimal using construction also obtain improved complementation construction biichi automaton aiso optimai construction used improve complexity decision procedure use automatatheoretic technique

One explanation for the devastating prognosis is the failure of many chemotherapies, including the current standard of care therapy gemcitabine. Although our knowledge of the molecular events underlying multistep carcinogenesis in PDA has steadily increased, translation into more effective therapeutic approaches has been inefficient over the last several decades. Evidence for this innate resistance to systemic therapies was recently provided in an accurate mouse model of PDA by the demonstration that chemotherapies are poorly delivered to PDA tissues because of a deficient vasculature. This vascular deficiency correlated with the presence of a dense stromal matrix that is a prominent histological hallmark of PDA tumours. Therapeutic targeting of stromal cells decreased the stroma from pancreatic tumours, resulting in increased intratumoral perfusion and therapeutic delivery of gemcitabine. Stromal cells contained within the PDA tumour microenvironment therefore represent an additional constituent to neoplastic cells that should be critically evaluated for optimal therapeutic development in preclinical models and early clinical trials.",Medicine,4,0,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pda almost uniformly lethal disease one explanation devastating prognosis failure many chemotherapy including current standard care therapy gemcitabine although knowledge molecular event underlying multistep carcinogenesis pda steadily increased translation effective therapeutic approach inefficient last several decade evidence innate resistance systemic therapy recently provided accurate mouse model pda demonstration chemotherapy poorly delivered pda tissue deficient vasculature vascular deficiency correlated presence dense stromal matrix prominent histological hallmark pda tumour therapeutic targeting stromal cell decreased stroma pancreatic tumour resulting increased intratumoral perfusion therapeutic delivery gemcitabine stromal cell contained within pda tumour microenvironment therefore represent additional constituent neoplastic cell critically evaluated optimal therapeutic development preclinical model early clinical trial

Twenty-four maxillary fourth premolar teeth were harvested from dog cadavers. Samples consisted of teeth with surrounding alveolar bone potted in polycarbonate cylinders filled with acrylic. The cylinders were held by an aluminum device at an angle of 60° with respect to the ground. An axial compression test was performed, creating a force upon the occluso-palatal aspects of the main cusps of the crowns of the teeth. The highest compressive force prior to failure was considered the maximum force sustained by the teeth. Results showed the mean maximum force (± SD) sustained by the tested teeth at the point of fracture was 1,281 N (± 403 N) at a mean impact angle (± SD) of 59.7° (± 5.2°). The most common fracture type that occurred among all samples was a complicated crown fracture (n = 12), followed by an uncomplicated crown fracture (n = 6), complicated crown-root fracture (n = 5), and uncomplicated crown-root fracture (n = 1). There was no statistically significant correlation between dog breed, age, weight, impact angle, crown height or crown diameter, and the maximum force applied at the point of fracture. The only independent variable that remained significantly associated with maximum force was the crown height to diameter ratio (p = 0.005), suggesting that a decreased ratio increases tooth fracture resistance.

Two different species of Hepatozoon infect dogs - Hepatozoon canis in the Old World and South America, and Hepatozoon americanum in the southern USA. H canis infection varies from being asymptomatic in dogs with a low parasitaemia, to causing severe disease with anaemia, profound lethargy and cachexia in dogs with large numbers of circulating parasites. H americanum infection manifests mainly as gait abnormalities and musculoskeletal pain due to myositis and periosteal bone lesions. Feline hepatozoonosis is associated with muscular pathology and is often reported in conjunction with a retroviral disease. The diagnosis of hepatozoonosis relies mainly on the detection of blood gamonts in the case of H canis infection, and on muscle biopsy showing tissue cysts and pyogranulomas for H americanum infection. Therapy for both forms of the disease involves long-term treatment with combinations of antiprotozoal drugs.

The understanding of apoptosis has provided the basis for novel targeted therapies that can induce death in cancer cells or sensitize them to established cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. These novel agents include those targeting the extrinsic pathway such as tumor necrosis factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptor 1, and those targeting the intrinsic Bcl‐2 family pathway such as antisense bcl‐2 oligonucleotides. Many pathways and proteins control the apoptosis machinery. Examples include p53, the nuclear factor kappa B, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway, and the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway. These can be targeted by specific modulators such as bortezomib, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as CCI‐779 and RAD 001. Because these pathways may be preferentially altered in tumor cells, there is potential for a selective effect in tumors sparing normal tissue.

High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest demonstrated a Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. Pulmonary function testing revealed an isolated mildly reduced diffusion capacity. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results confirmed the presence of foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells consistent with ongoing exposure. Open lung biopsy showed poorly formed granulomas and bronchiolitis. He was advised to avoid exposure to pyrethrin. While he declined to stop grooming dogs, on follow-up, his symptoms had improved with use of a P100 mask and better ventilation to protect himself when using the pet sprays. We conclude that sustained exposure to pyrethrin containing sprays in the pet grooming industry may be a risk factor for a novel occupation related hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Repeats are separated by spacers, some of them homologous to sequences in mobile genetic elements. Although the whole process involved remains uncharacterized, it is known that new spacers are incorporated into CRISPR loci of the host during a phage challenge, conferring specific resistance against the virus. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that such interference is based on small RNAs carrying a spacer. These RNAs would guide the defence apparatus to foreign molecules carrying sequences that match the spacers. Despite this essential role, the spacer uptake mechanism has not been addressed. A first step forward came from the detection of motifs associated with spacer precursors (proto-spacers) of Streptococcus thermophilus, revealing a specific recognition of donor sequences in this species. Here we show that the conservation of proto-spacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) is a common theme for the most diverse CRISPR systems. The PAM sequence depends on the CRISPR-CAS variant, implying that there is a CRISPR-type-specific (motif-directed) choice of the spacers, which subsequently determines the interference target. PAMs also direct the orientation of spacers in the repeat arrays. Remarkably, observations based on such polarity argue against a recognition of the spacer precursors on transcript RNA molecules as a general rule.",Medicine,4,0,clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr associated crisprassociated sequence ca protein constitute novel antiviral defence system widespread prokaryote repeat separated spacers homologous sequence mobile genetic element although whole process involved remains uncharacterized known new spacers incorporated crispr locus host phage challenge conferring specific resistance virus moreover demonstrated interference based small rna carrying spacer rna would guide defence apparatus foreign molecule carrying sequence match spacers despite essential role spacer uptake mechanism addressed first step forward came detection motif associated spacer precursor protospacers streptococcus thermophilus revealing specific recognition donor sequence specie show conservation protospacer adjacent motif pams common theme diverse crispr system pam sequence depends crisprcas variant implying crisprtypespecific motifdirected choice spacers subsequently determines interference target pams also direct orientation spacers repeat array remarkably observation based polarity argue recognition spacer precursor transcript rna molecule general rule

Thus, drugs that selectively target cancer stem cells offer great promise for cancer treatment, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Here, we show that low doses of metformin, a standard drug for diabetes, inhibits cellular transformation and selectively kills cancer stem cells in four genetically different types of breast cancer. The combination of metformin and a well-defined chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, kills both cancer stem cells and non-stem cancer cells in culture. Furthermore, this combinatorial therapy reduces tumor mass and prevents relapse much more effectively than either drug alone in a xenograft mouse model. Mice seem to remain tumor-free for at least 2 months after combinatorial therapy with metformin and doxorubicin is ended.

To evaluate the visual outcome of three techniques of corneal transplantation surgery in treating severe inflammatory keratopathies in the horse.


DESIGN
Retrospective medical records study.


ANIMALS STUDIED
Medical records of 206 horses that received corneal transplantation surgery at the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center from 1993 to 2007 were reviewed.


PROCEDURE
Data collected from the medical records included signalment, types of ocular lesions, type of transplant surgery performed, length of follow-up, complications, and visual outcomes.


RESULTS
Full thickness penetrating keratoplasty (PK) was performed in 86 horses for melting ulcers, iris prolapse/descemetoceles, and medically nonresponsive full thickness stromal abscesses (SA). Posterior lamellar keratoplasty (PLK) and deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) are split thickness penetrating keratoplasties that were utilized for medically nonresponsive deep stromal abscesses (DSA) in 54 and 66 eyes, respectively. The most common postoperative surgical complication was graft rejection and varying degrees of graft opacification. Wound dehiscence and aqueous humor leakage was also a common postoperative problem. A positive visual outcome was achieved for PK, PLK, and DLEK in 77.9%, 98.1%, and 89.4%, respectively.

Twelve of these dogs were evaluated before and after two weeks of oral bronchodilator administration. Thoracic radiographs, tidal breathing flow-volume loops, radioaerosol ventilation scans, airway appearance at bronchoscopy, and airway pathology were abnormal in the majority of dogs studied. There was a significant relationship between abnormal ventilation scans and abnormal results for PaO2 and end-tidal airflow.

The dental professional, using a variety of diagnostic techniques, will discern the condition from other conditions that may cause sensitive teeth. Treatment of the condition can be invasive or non-invasive in nature. The most inexpensive and efficacious first line of treatment for most patients is a dentifrice containing a desensitizing active ingredient such as potassium nitrate and/or stannous fluoride.

To investigate the prevalence of microscopic subchondral bone injury in the distal metacarpi/tarsi of Thoroughbred racehorses and associations with recent and cumulative training history.


METHODS
Metacarpi/metatarsi were obtained from postmortem examination of Thoroughbred racehorses. The severity of palmar/plantar osteochondral disease (POD) was graded in forelimbs from 38 horses and in hindlimbs from a separate cohort of 45 horses. Forelimb samples were embedded in methyl methacrylate and examined using backscattered scanning electron microscopy. Microfracture density in the condylar subchondral bone was determined. Horizontal subchondral bone fractures were identified in hindlimb samples using sections of demineralised tissue. Empty osteocyte lacunae were quantified in hindlimb samples using sections of demineralised tissue.


RESULTS
The prevalence of gross POD was 65.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48.7-80.4%) in the forelimb and 57.8% (95% CI 42.2-72.3%) in the hindlimb cohort of horses. Microfractures occurred in the forelimbs of 97.4% (95% CI 86.2-99.9%) of horses. Microfracture density in forelimbs increased with age (rs  = 0.50, P = 0.001), the number of race starts (rs  = 0.47, P = 0.003) and was greater in the medial condyles of horses in training than in those not in training (n = 21, median: 3.1/mm; range: 0.8-10.0 vs n = 17, 1.4/mm; 0-4.5, P = 0.008). Empty osteocyte lacunae were observed in the subchondral bone of hindlimbs in 97.7% (95% CI 88.0-99.9%) of 44 horses.

A 1-year-old sexually intact female Netherland dwarf rabbit was examined because of a 3-week history of signs of lethargy, decreased appetite, left unilateral exophthalmia, a previous draining sinus from a left maxillary facial abscess, and bilateral nasal discharge.


CLINICAL FINDINGS
The rabbit weighed 1.0 kg (2.2 lb) and had a body condition score of 1.5/5. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle atrophy, bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge, and severe left-sided exophthalmia. Diagnostic investigation revealed anemia, neutrophilia, severe dental disease, a superficial corneal ulcer of the left eye, and a retrobulbar abscess.


TREATMENT AND OUTCOME
Stomatoscopy-aided dental trimming, tooth removal, and abscess debridement were performed. Antimicrobials were flushed into the tooth abscess cavity, and antimicrobial treatment was initiated on the basis of cytologic findings and results of bacterial culture and susceptibility testing.

Numerous techniques have been previously described to repair palatal defects, and the most appropriate choice is based on the clinical features of the defect and information obtained from advanced diagnostic imaging. Acquired palatal defects are not predictable in shape, size, and location; therefore, although the literature contains many different surgical techniques, these are not always reliable.

The very concept and the phenotypic boundaries of schizophrenia are still unclear and continue to stir up intense controversies (for a comprehensive debate, see 1). Recent worldwide attempts to establish programs for early detection and therapeutic intervention in schizophrenia have inadvertently revealed an embarrassing lacuna in the contemporary operationalist psychopathology, i.e., a lack of descriptions of subtle pathology that might be useful for early, prodromal diagnosis (2). This state of affairs is, to a non-trivial extent, caused by a dramatic simplification of psychopathology that has taken place over the last decades, now echoed by raising concerns expressed in the editorials of major journals (3-6). The operational diagnostic criteria specify in detail what schizophrenia is not (e.g. not an affective or organic disorder) rather than affording the psychiatrist with a solid conceptual-clinical grip of what it is (3). Yet, a crucial and primary component of the diagnostic validity is exactly to offer a certain conceptualization or typification of what a given disorder is in the first place (7), an aspect that is conspicuously absent in the contemporary nosological debates. All classic psychopathologists agreed that, diagnostically speaking, a certain characteristic Gestalt, irreducible to single symptoms or signs, distinguished the schizophrenia spectrum from other disorders. The terms used in this context were 'diagnosis through intuition' (8), 'atmospheric diagnosis' (9), 'Praecox Gefuhl' (10), and 'diagnostic par penetration' (11). All these terms converge in pointing to an intersubjective nature of this Gestalt. The concept of autism, introduced by Bleuler in 1911 (12), was the first thorough attempt to capture the clinical essence of schizophrenia and therefore played an important role in its definitions until the advent of the operational criteria. It will serve us as a departure in addressing the phenomenology of the trait features of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",Medicine,4,0,purpose contribution address phenomenologically informed empirical perspective essential clinical feature schizophrenia spectrum disorder suggest potential import pathogenetic research clinical praxis concept phenotypic boundary schizophrenia still unclear continue stir intense controversy comprehensive debate see recent worldwide attempt establish program early detection therapeutic intervention schizophrenia inadvertently revealed embarrassing lacuna contemporary operationalist psychopathology ie lack description subtle pathology might useful early prodromal diagnosis state affair nontrivial extent caused dramatic simplification psychopathology taken place last decade echoed raising concern expressed editorial major journal operational diagnostic criterion specify detail schizophrenia eg affective organic disorder rather affording psychiatrist solid conceptualclinical grip yet crucial primary component diagnostic validity exactly offer certain conceptualization typification given disorder first place aspect conspicuously absent contemporary nosological debate classic psychopathologists agreed diagnostically speaking certain characteristic gestalt irreducible single symptom sign distinguished schizophrenia spectrum disorder term used context diagnosis intuition atmospheric diagnosis praecox gefuhl diagnostic par penetration term converge pointing intersubjective nature gestalt concept autism introduced bleuler first thorough attempt capture clinical essence schizophrenia therefore played important role definition advent operational criterion serve u departure addressing phenomenology trait feature schizophrenia spectrum disorder

All teeth were normal and were rasped to a standard considered satisfactory in practice. Six teeth from each horse served as untreated controls. Following treatment, the teeth were extracted and the clinical crown removed and prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Teeth were also extracted and examined from a horse that had excessive dental treatment previously. Dental debris created by the procedures was collected and examined. All three rasp techniques resulted in amputation of odontoblast processes. The solid carbide blade cut deep gouges and grooves into the surface of the dentin, chipping the enamel and peripheral cement. No smear layer was created. Rasping with a tungsten chip blade created a partial smear layer and a smoother surface than the solid carbide blade. The electrically-driven bur produced a complete smear layer and removed all dental tissues to a smooth layer. The enamel had also been damaged by the electric bur. Crown particles collected after the procedures were larger following hand rasping compared with particles produced by the electric bur. The extent of damage to sensitive and vital dentin tissue was of concern.

This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of how neutrophils are produced, how these cells leave the circulation, the molecular events regulating neutrophil activation and, ultimately, how these cells die and are removed. The neutrophil is now recognized as a highly versatile and sophisticated cell with significant synthetic capacity and an important role in linking the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. One of the key challenges in conditions such as COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and certain forms of asthma is how to manipulate neutrophil function in a way that does not compromise antibacterial and antifungal capacity. The possession by neutrophils of a unique repertoire of surface receptors and signaling proteins may make such targeted therapy possible.",Medicine,3,0,many lung disease characterized neutrophildominated inflammation therefore understanding neutrophil function considerable importance respiratory physician review focus recent advance understanding neutrophil produced cell leave circulation molecular event regulating neutrophil activation ultimately cell die removed neutrophil recognized highly versatile sophisticated cell significant synthetic capacity important role linking innate adaptive arm immune response one key challenge condition copd bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis certain form asthma manipulate neutrophil function way compromise antibacterial antifungal capacity possession neutrophil unique repertoire surface receptor signaling protein may make targeted therapy possible

Knowledge about it began, in antiquity, through artists, particularly Greek and Roman, and then Japanese in the 18th century with their representation of cauliflower deformation of the ear on sculptures and paintings of pugilists and wrestlers. It is only in the 19th century that physicians began to make substantive progress in understanding this abnormality. It was first thought to be associated with mental disease, but by the beginning of the 20th century, its etiology was recognized as being caused by trauma and was then named auricular hematoma. The second step in the understanding of this affliction was the observation that auricular hematoma progresses toward cauliflower deformation of the ear, which was named cauliflower ear. Recognition of this evolution led to the development of therapies. During the second half of the 20th century, different treatments were developed. They included various hematoma drainage techniques with special bandages to prevent hematoma recurrence and ensuing progression to cauliflower ear. In summary, cauliflower deformation of the ear is an old artistic affliction that has only recently received medical attention.",Medicine,2,0,abstract auricular hematoma cauliflower deformation ear unique several respect knowledge began antiquity artist particularly greek roman japanese th century representation cauliflower deformation ear sculpture painting pugilist wrestler th century physician began make substantive progress understanding abnormality first thought associated mental disease beginning th century etiology recognized caused trauma named auricular hematoma second step understanding affliction observation auricular hematoma progress toward cauliflower deformation ear named cauliflower ear recognition evolution led development therapy second half th century different treatment developed included various hematoma drainage technique special bandage prevent hematoma recurrence ensuing progression cauliflower ear summary cauliflower deformation ear old artistic affliction recently received medical attention

For the past two decades, pimozide has been considered the drug of choice. Although a few controlled studies have been done to support the efficacy of pimozide, the recommendation of treatment of choice is largely based on case reports. Pimozide has significant side effects, including cardiac and extrapyramidal abnormalities, which are of most concern in the treatment of the elderly. Although pimozide does appear to be effective in some cases of somatic delusional disorders, newer antipsychotics such as risperidone have also been shown to be beneficial in treating this perplexing cluster of disorders.

Injection-induced earthquakes pose a serious seismic hazard but also offer an opportunity to gain insight into earthquake physics. Currently used models relating the maximum magnitude of injection-induced earthquakes to injection parameters do not incorporate rupture physics. We develop theoretical estimates, validated by simulations, of the size of ruptures induced by localized pore-pressure perturbations and propagating on prestressed faults. Our model accounts for ruptures growing beyond the perturbed area and distinguishes self-arrested from runaway ruptures. We develop a theoretical scaling relation between the largest magnitude of self-arrested earthquakes and the injected volume and find it consistent with observed maximum magnitudes of injection-induced earthquakes over a broad range of injected volumes, suggesting that, although runaway ruptures are possible, most injection-induced events so far have been self-arrested ruptures.",Medicine,4,0,theoretical model rupture arrest indicates injectioninduced earthquake selfarrested injectioninduced earthquake pose serious seismic hazard also offer opportunity gain insight earthquake physic currently used model relating maximum magnitude injectioninduced earthquake injection parameter incorporate rupture physic develop theoretical estimate validated simulation size rupture induced localized porepressure perturbation propagating prestressed fault model account rupture growing beyond perturbed area distinguishes selfarrested runaway rupture develop theoretical scaling relation largest magnitude selfarrested earthquake injected volume find consistent observed maximum magnitude injectioninduced earthquake broad range injected volume suggesting although runaway rupture possible injectioninduced event far selfarrested rupture

A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Medicine,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

They are defined exclusively by their occurrence close to delivery. Attempts to further diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychoses have been prevented to date by the influence of Kraepelin's dichotomy. New possibilities of nosological differentiation arose out of Kasanin's (1933) description of schizoaffective psychoses and out of Leonhard's differentiated nosology (1986). The objective of the present, retrospective study was to apply Leonhard's nosology to 42 postpartal psychoses. Five diagnostic groups could be identified: 6 cases of manic-depressive disorder, 7 cases of pure depression, 8 cases of pure melancholia, 2 cases of unsystematic schizophrenia, and 19 cases of cycloid psychoses.

In the past decade, effector T cells, engineered to express highly specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize tumor antigens, have been shown to be highly effective adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) that have revolutionized certain cancer treatments. In 2017, the first two CAR–T cell therapies were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of various CD19+ B cell lymphomas, and extensive clinical trials are now under way to expand the therapies to multiple solid tumor settings (1, 2). Here, we speculate on the next generation of immune cell therapies for non-cancer diseases. Specifically, we highlight the progress toward developing a new class of ACT using regulatory T cells (Tregs) to treat autoimmune diseases—including type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) that can occur after bone marrow transplantation, and organ transplant rejection—and potentially to treat nonimmune diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (3).",Medicine,2,0,regulatory cell frontline therapy autoimmunity disease past decade effector cell engineered express highly specific chimeric antigen receptor car antigenspecific cell receptor tcrs recognize tumor antigen shown highly effective adoptive cell therapy act revolutionized certain cancer treatment first two cart cell therapy approved u food drug administration treatment various cd b cell lymphoma extensive clinical trial way expand therapy multiple solid tumor setting speculate next generation immune cell therapy noncancer disease specifically highlight progress toward developing new class act using regulatory cell tregs treat autoimmune diseasesincluding type diabetes td rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease ibd graftversushost disease gvhd occur bone marrow transplantation organ transplant rejectionand potentially treat nonimmune disease alzheimers disease parkinson disease heart disease type diabetes

The cycloid psychoses with low heritability and a good long‐term prognosis were found to be significantly associated with first‐trimester respiratory infection (i.e. influenza and febrile cold). Furthermore, maternal infection seems to predict an early onset in cycloids. In manic depression, we failed to identify a significant link with maternal gestational infection or other obstetric complications. These findings are discussed in the light of our previous reports of an excess of maternal gestational infections during the second trimester in chronic schizophrenics.

Unfortunately, many of them are still recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which is a bottleneck for systematic metabolic engineering. To facilitate the genetic manipulation of actinomycetes, we developed a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete gene(s) or gene cluster(s), implement precise gene replacements, and reversibly control gene expression in actinomycetes. We demonstrate our system by targeting two genes, actIORF1 (SCO5087) and actVB (SCO5092), from the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Our CRISPR-Cas9 system successfully inactivated the targeted genes. When no templates for homology-directed repair (HDR) were present, the site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by Cas9 were repaired through the error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in a library of deletions with variable sizes around the targeted sequence. If templates for HDR were provided at the same time, precise deletions of the targeted gene were observed with near 100% frequency. Moreover, we developed a system to efficiently and reversibly control expression of target genes, deemed CRISPRi, based on a catalytically dead variant of Cas9 (dCas9).

As common as they are, they are not a simple undertaking and should be approached with the same depth of preparation as any other surgical procedure. Regardless of size of the tooth, all extractions start with the 9 steps used for simple single-root extractions. These are: obtain consent, expose a dental radiograph, obtain proper lighting and visualization, administer proper pain management, cut the gingival attachment, elevate carefully, remove the tooth, perform alveoplasty, and close. Multi-root teeth require sectioning into single-rooted pieces, which are then treated as single-root extractions.

They can differentiate to multiple lineages and can participate in organized cell replacement therapy, but engraftment after delivery in vivo remains low. However, MSCs produce many cytokines and growth factors that influence other cells producing decreased inflammation, enhanced progenitor cell proliferation, improved tissue repair and decreased infection. MSCs have also been shown to donate mitochondria via tunneling nanotubes to damaged cells. More recently, the MSC production and release of membrane bound packets—microvesicles (>200 nm) and exosomes ( 50–200 nm)— encapsulate cytokines/growth factors/RNAs/miRNAs in diverse combinations. These vesicles are being tested in experimental systems previously tested with the cells themselves. Remarkably, the vesicle preparations have shown results very similar to MSC transplantation in many cases, while avoiding many risks associated with cell transplantation. However, many important tasks remain before MSC-derived vesicle therapy can be used clinically, including standardized production, vesicle characterization, improving isolation and yield optimization, reproducibility, an assay for potency, determining dosage for particular clinical indication and standardized production—all similar to parameters needed for MSC cell therapy.

Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the univariable and multivariable relationships between the predictor variables and the risk of falling. The risk of falling was significantly associated with the position of the jump in the race, and with the distance and speed of the race. A horse's previous racing experience and history were also significantly associated with the risk of fallng and horses participating in their first hurdle race were at almost five times greater risk of falling than horses that had hurdled before.",Medicine,1,0,march august casecontrol study conducted racecourse england wale identify quantify risk factor associated horse fall hurdle race case control defined variable relating horse jockey race racecourse jump could considered case defined jumping effort hurdle flight resulted fall control defined successful jump hurdle racecourse within day case fall conditional logistic regression used examine univariable multivariable relationship predictor variable risk falling risk falling significantly associated position jump race distance speed race horse previous racing experience history also significantly associated risk fallng horse participating first hurdle race almost five time greater risk falling horse hurdled

In PDT, a photosensitizer (PS) is administered that can be activated by light of a specific wavelength, which causes selective damage to the tumor and its surrounding vasculature. The success of PDT is limited by the difficulty in administering photosensitizers (PSs) with low water solubility, which compromises the clinical use of several molecules. Incorporation of PSs in nanostructured drug delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), hydrogels, liposomes, liquid crystals, dendrimers, and cyclodextrin is a potential strategy to overcome this difficulty. Additionally, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems may improve the transcytosis of a PS across epithelial and endothelial barriers and afford the simultaneous co-delivery of two or more drugs. Based on this, the application of nanotechnology in medicine may offer numerous exciting possibilities in cancer treatment and improve the efficacy of available therapeutics. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems for photodynamic therapy of cancer.",Medicine,3,0,photodynamic therapy pdt promising alternative approach improved cancer treatment pdt photosensitizer p administered activated light specific wavelength cause selective damage tumor surrounding vasculature success pdt limited difficulty administering photosensitizers ps low water solubility compromise clinical use several molecule incorporation ps nanostructured drug delivery system polymeric nanoparticles pnps solid lipid nanoparticles slns nanostructured lipid carrier nlcs gold nanoparticles aunps hydrogel liposome liquid crystal dendrimers cyclodextrin potential strategy overcome difficulty additionally nanotechnologybased drug delivery system may improve transcytosis p across epithelial endothelial barrier afford simultaneous codelivery two drug based application nanotechnology medicine may offer numerous exciting possibility cancer treatment improve efficacy available therapeutic therefore aim paper review nanotechnologybased drug delivery system photodynamic therapy cancer

However, despite the strength of the association, it only accounted for 2% of the variance, indicating that contributions from other genes were probable. In the present study, we investigated the original cohort of subjects to evaluate the gene for the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor alpha-1 subunit (GABRA1). The possible association of GABRA1 with the psychopathology of major psychoses was tested both alone and in interaction with DRD4. Four hundred and sixty-one inpatients affected by major psychoses were assessed by the operational criteria checklist for psychotic illness (OPCRIT) and were also typed for the DRD4 and GABRA1 variants using PCR techniques. Mania, depression, delusion, and disorganization were the four symptomatologic factors used as phenotype definitions. GABRA1 variants were not associated with these symptomatologic factors, and consideration of possible stratification effects such as sex and psychiatric diagnosis also did not reveal any association. GABRA1 variants did not significantly influence the association of DRD4 with delusional symptoms. No interaction was observed on the other symptom factors.

Despite surgical and medical advances, the prognosis for most brain cancer patients remains dismal and the median survival rarely exceeds 16 months. Drug delivery to the brain is significantly hindered by the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which serves as a protective semi-permeable membrane for the central nervous system. Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have yielded multifunctional theranostic nanoplatforms with the ability to cross or bypass the BBB, enabling accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of brain tumours. Herein, we make our efforts to present a comprehensive review on the latest remarkable advances in BBB-crossing nanotechnology, with an emphasis on the judicious design of multifunctional nanoplatforms for effective BBB penetration, efficient tumour accumulation, precise tumour imaging, and significant tumour inhibition of brain cancer. The detailed elucidation of BBB-crossing nanotechnology in this review is anticipated to attract broad interest from researchers in diverse fields to participate in the establishment of powerful BBB-crossing nanoplatforms for highly efficient brain cancer theranostics.",Medicine,1,0,brain cancer especially common type glioblastoma highly invasive known one devastating deadly neoplasm despite surgical medical advance prognosis brain cancer patient remains dismal median survival rarely exceeds month drug delivery brain significantly hindered existence bloodbrain barrier bbb serf protective semipermeable membrane central nervous system recent breakthrough nanotechnology yielded multifunctional theranostic nanoplatforms ability cross bypass bbb enabling accurate diagnosis effective treatment brain tumour herein make effort present comprehensive review latest remarkable advance bbbcrossing nanotechnology emphasis judicious design multifunctional nanoplatforms effective bbb penetration efficient tumour accumulation precise tumour imaging significant tumour inhibition brain cancer detailed elucidation bbbcrossing nanotechnology review anticipated attract broad interest researcher diverse field participate establishment powerful bbbcrossing nanoplatforms highly efficient brain cancer theranostics

They have been identified in blood, breast, brain, colon, melanoma, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, lung cancers and so on. It is often considered to be associated with chemo-resistance and radio-resistance that lead to the failure of traditional therapies. Most therapies are directed at the fast growing tumor mass but not the slow dividing cancer stem cells. Eradicating cancer stem cells, the root of cancer origin and recurrence, has been thought as a promising approach to improve cancer survival or even to cure cancer patients.

In this study photographs were taken of the dentition of 434 thoroughbreds of known age. Four experienced equine clinicians provided estimates of the ages of the horses from the photographs. A comparison of the estimated and true ages showed large discrepancies in many cases and the discrepancies increased as the horse's true age increased. The results show that the ageing of horses from their dentition is an imprecise science. It is suggested that written records of the dental features are made on each occasion when a dental examination is made and that veterinary surgeons advise clients that estimating a horse's age from dental criteria can provide no more than an 'informed guess'.,Medicine,3,0,widely held belief horse accurately aged examination teeth belief recently questioned study photograph taken dentition thoroughbred known age four experienced equine clinician provided estimate age horse photograph comparison estimated true age showed large discrepancy many case discrepancy increased horse true age increased result show ageing horse dentition imprecise science suggested written record dental feature made occasion dental examination made veterinary surgeon advise client estimating horse age dental criterion provide informed guess

Report on a Family,"The classification and nature of psychoses with both schizophrenic and manic-depressive symptoms is still highly controversial. The original view based on the Kraepelinian dichotomy of endogenous psychoses was that the “mixed” or “schizo-affective” psychoses were mixed also in a genetic sense. This would mean that some individuals inherit both schizophrenic and manic-depressive Anlage. This view has not been confirmed. One alternative is that proposed by Kleist and Leonhard, namely, that atypical forms of endogenous psychoses exist, which are genetically independent of both schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis. It seems, however, that Leonhard's concept has attracted little attention. Slater (1953) stated that Leonhard's work was “most interesting”, but hardly mentions it in his text-book of psychiatry (Mayer-Gross, Slater and Roth, 1960).

Cases involving projectiles are complicated by gross similarities to other common types of injury, including bite wounds and motor vehicle injuries, by weapons and ammunition not commonly recognized or understood by veterinary medical professionals, and by required expertise beyond that employed in routine postmortem examination. This review describes the common types of projectile injuries encountered within the United States, as well as firearms and ammunition associated with this form of injury. The 3 stages of ballistics—internal, external, and terminal—and wounding capacity are discussed. A general understanding of firearms, ammunition, and ballistics is necessary before pursuing forensic projectile cases. The forensic necropsy is described, including gunshot wound examination, projectile trajectories, different imaging procedures, collection and storage of projectile evidence, and potential advanced techniques for gunpowder analysis.

In this engaging study, Hent de Vries argues that a turn to religion discernible in recent philosophy anticipates and accompanies this development in the contemporary world. Though the book reaches back to Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, and earlier, it takes its inspiration from the tradition of French phenomenology, notably Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion, and, especially, Jacques Derrida. Tracing how Derrida probes the discourse on religion, its metaphysical presuppositions, and its transformations, de Vries shows how this author consistently foregrounds the unexpected alliances between a radical interrogation of the history of Western philosophy and the religious inheritance from which that philosophy has increasingly sought to set itself apart. De Vries goes beyond formal analogies between the textual practices of deconstruction and so-called negative theology to address the necessity for a philosophical thinking that situates itself at once close to and at the farthest remove from traditional manifestations of the religious and the theological. This paradox is captured in the phrase adieu ( a dieu), borrowed from Levinas, which signals at once a turn toward and a leave-taking from God-and which also gestures toward and departs from the other of this divine other, the possibility of radical evil. Only by confronting such uncanny and difficult figures, de Vries claims, can one begin to think and act upon the ethical and political imperatives of our day.",Medicine,4,0,religion seemed played role intellectual political history western secular modernity returned vengeance engaging study hent de vries argues turn religion discernible recent philosophy anticipates accompanies development contemporary world though book reach back immanuel kant martin heidegger earlier take inspiration tradition french phenomenology notably emmanuel levinas jeanluc marion especially jacques derrida tracing derrida probe discourse religion metaphysical presupposition transformation de vries show author consistently foreground unexpected alliance radical interrogation history western philosophy religious inheritance philosophy increasingly sought set apart de vries go beyond formal analogy textual practice deconstruction socalled negative theology address necessity philosophical thinking situates close farthest remove traditional manifestation religious theological paradox captured phrase adieu dieu borrowed levinas signal turn toward leavetaking godand also gesture toward departs divine possibility radical evil confronting uncanny difficult figure de vries claim one begin think act upon ethical political imperative day

Unbeknown to many, reductionist and postmodern worldviews competitively coexist in science and society. The debate on evidence-based medicine (EBM) is at the tip of this 'iceberg'. Via systems thinking and complexity science EBM reveals crucial flaws and its reductionism entails an inability to appreciate (even tolerate) contrasting ideas and/or 'see a bigger picture'. An interdisciplinary approach provides insight into novel explanations. Thereafter, the conceptual barrier shifts to communication, a challenge which mandates attempts to steer the discourse by reframing the debate.


METHOD
Interdisciplinary perspectives serve to illustrate a 'bigger picture'. Also, 'wicked' questions stimulate reflection, discern leverage points and dismantle resilient defences. Lastly, a proposal: exploring the value of 'glasses half full'.

A buccal portion (‘slab’) had separated from the tooth, which extended subgingivally into root structure. Following completion of standard root canal therapy, a periodontal flap was elevated. Alveolectomy and alveoloplasty were performed, and inflamed soft tissues were debrided. The fracture site was prepared, restored, and shaped to receive a dental bulge contour. A gingival collar expansion technique was utilized to allow for apical positioning of gingiva at the distobuccal crown-root segment. Clinical and radiographic examination 15-months following treatment showed no evidence of endodontic failure. The restorations were intact, and periodontal probing depths were slightly increased probably due to gingival enlargement from concurrent cyclosporine therapy.

Transplantation of MSCs to treat cardiac disease has always been predicated on the hypothesis that these cells would engraft, differentiate and replace damaged cardiac tissues. However, experimental or clinical observations so far have failed to demonstrate a therapeutically relevant level of transplanted MSC engraftment or differentiation. Instead, they indicate that transplanted MSCs secrete factors to reduce tissue injury and/or enhance tissue repair. Here we review the evidences supporting this hypothesis including the recent identification of exosome as a therapeutic agent in MSC secretion. In particular, we will discuss the potential and practicality of using this relatively novel entity as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of cardiac disease, particularly acute myocardial infarction.",Medicine,1,0,cardiovascular disease major target many experimental stem cellbased therapy mesenchymal stem cell msc widely used therapy transplantation msc treat cardiac disease always predicated hypothesis cell would engraft differentiate replace damaged cardiac tissue however experimental clinical observation far failed demonstrate therapeutically relevant level transplanted msc engraftment differentiation instead indicate transplanted msc secrete factor reduce tissue injury andor enhance tissue repair review evidence supporting hypothesis including recent identification exosome therapeutic agent msc secretion particular discus potential practicality using relatively novel entity therapeutic modality treatment cardiac disease particularly acute myocardial infarction

This paper reports the incidence of radiographic lesions of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the femoropatellar joint relative to the development of clinical symptoms in the 1989 foal crop, and the clinical symptoms, radiographic features and outcome of the 1990 and 1991 foal crops affected with OCD at the same Thoroughbred farm. In the 1989 foal crop, 23 of 96 yearlings were identified with clinical and/or radiographic signs of OCD. They had an average age of 12.6 months at identification. Eighteen cases had clinical and radiographic signs of osteochondrosis, 3 had clinical signs in the stifles without radiographic signs and 2 had radiographic signs of osteochondrosis but no clinical signs (one eventually became symptomatic). Of the cases with clinical signs but no radiographic signs, one subsequently developed radiographic signs and the other 2 had bilateral clinical signs and unilateral radiographic signs. Seven horses had surgery at the time of clinical and radiographic diagnosis; 5 subsequently raced, 1 is in training and 1 has persistent problems. Of 11 cases not operated initially, 6 raced, 3 had no follow-up, 1 became a jumper and 1 was operated later. In the 1990 foal crop, 13 of 120 foals were diagnosed with femoropatellar OCD. The average age at diagnosis was 9 months. Nine of the foals had radiographic lesions, 3 had equivocal radiographic lesions (1 progressed to an obvious lesion) and 1 had no radiographic lesions of the femoropatellar joint (but did have them in the fetlocks). All but one horse were treated conservatively. Of the horses with radiographic lesions initially, 2 have raced, 2 are still unraced, 3 have lameness and 2 were used for non-racing careers. One horse had equivocal lesions initially but these progressed. In the 1991 foal crop, there were 16 cases of femoropatellar OCD diagnosed out of 125 foals. The average age at clinical recognition was 6 months. Ten horses had radiographic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis, 5 had no radiographic lesions initially but subsequently developed them, and 1 never had a radiographic lesion. Four horses were sold as yearlings reportedly without synovial effusion or lameness, 1 died of unrelated causes, 10 are currently racing or training and 1 subsequently developed OCD of the metatarsophalangeal joints.",Medicine,1,0,summary paper report incidence radiographic lesion osteochondritis dissecans ocd femoropatellar joint relative development clinical symptom foal crop clinical symptom radiographic feature outcome foal crop affected ocd thoroughbred farm foal crop yearling identified clinical andor radiographic sign ocd average age month identification eighteen case clinical radiographic sign osteochondrosis clinical sign stifle without radiographic sign radiographic sign osteochondrosis clinical sign one eventually became symptomatic case clinical sign radiographic sign one subsequently developed radiographic sign bilateral clinical sign unilateral radiographic sign seven horse surgery time clinical radiographic diagnosis subsequently raced training persistent problem case operated initially raced followup became jumper operated later foal crop foal diagnosed femoropatellar ocd average age diagnosis month nine foal radiographic lesion equivocal radiographic lesion progressed obvious lesion radiographic lesion femoropatellar joint fetlock one horse treated conservatively horse radiographic lesion initially raced still unraced lameness used nonracing career one horse equivocal lesion initially progressed foal crop case femoropatellar ocd diagnosed foal average age clinical recognition month ten horse radiographic lesion time initial diagnosis radiographic lesion initially subsequently developed never radiographic lesion four horse sold yearling reportedly without synovial effusion lameness died unrelated cause currently racing training subsequently developed ocd metatarsophalangeal joint

This opened new pathogenic and psychopathologic horizons in connection with the aetiology of psychoses, as was particularly exemplified by Bonhoeffer in the 'catatonic psychoses'. Later, his concept of Symptomatic psychoses was further developed. Especially the symptom of an impaired consciousness as a diagnostic criterion in delirium underwent a critical discussion. However, Bonhoeffer's basic positions have not even now lost their significance. They find their representation in a modified form in all of the recent classification systems ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The study of pathogenic, clinic-psychopathologic, classificatory and therapeutic perspectives in detail, following Bonhoeffer's example, remains an important task for neuropsychiatry in the present as well as the future.",Medicine,3,0,description classification symptomatic psychosis karl bonhoeffer laid foundation categorization exogenous endogenous psychosis opened new pathogenic psychopathologic horizon connection aetiology psychosis particularly exemplified bonhoeffer catatonic psychosis later concept symptomatic psychosis developed especially symptom impaired consciousness diagnostic criterion delirium underwent critical discussion however bonhoeffer basic position even lost significance find representation modified form recent classification system icd dsmiv study pathogenic clinicpsychopathologic classificatory therapeutic perspective detail following bonhoeffer example remains important task neuropsychiatry present well future

For systematic review, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cell therapy versus no cell therapy in CLI were searched from PubMed and the Cochrane library databases. Outcome measures included major amputation, complete ulcer healing, ankle–brachial index (ABI), and all-cause mortality. Data were pooled using 16 RCTs, involving 774 patients. Compared with no cell therapy, cell therapy significantly reduced major amputation (odds ratio [OR]: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34-0.87: P = .01) and improved ulcer healing (OR: 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-5.82; P < .01) and ABI (OR: 5.91; 95% CI: 1.85-18.86: P < .01).

More than 90% of thoroughbred horses in the training season and approximately 60% of racing horses from other disciplines have gastric ulcers. Excessive secretion of gastric acid, impairment of gastric mucosal blood flow, weakening of prostaglandin E or the gastric mucus/bicarbonate layer, and gastric emptying disorders are important factors in the onset of ulceration. In this study, 12 horses with poor performance were evaluated using gastroscopy following clinical examinations. Gastroscopy revealed ulceration in 5 horses and ulcerative lesions in 7. A daily dose of 4 mg/kg omeprazole was administered orally for 4 weeks in all horses with clinically suspected gastritis, with or without gastric lesions. At the end of this time, a protective dose of 2 mg/kg per day of omeprazole was used for an additional 2 weeks. No rest for the horses was advised during the medical treatment period. According to the histories obtained from riders and trainers, all horses showed improved performance during the second week of treatment. No gastric lesions were detected at endoscopic examination following medical treatment of horses with gastric ulcerative lesions. In conclusion, gastric ulcer syndrome with or without gastric lesions in sport horses is a significant problem causing poor performance.

Little attention has been paid, however, to the evolution of FN surgery, a subject with a remarkably rich and engaging history. In the early 13th century, Roland, an Italian surgeon, used a red hot iron to coapt severed nerve endings. In the 17th century, Ferrara, another Italian, sutured injured nerves with tortoise tendon dipped in hot red wine. It was not until the late 19th century that peripheral nerve suture became a subject of serious scientific study. Although it is ironic, the course of events suggests that the evolution of FN repair was greatly stimulated by the development of the modern mastoid operation. Whereas the simple mastoid operation practiced by Wilde (1853) and others carried little risk of FN injury, more adventuresome procedures such as radical mastoidectomy (Kessel, 1885) carried a much greater risk. The abundance of iatrogenic palsies during this era undoubtedly did much to motivate surgeons to seek a better means of restoring facial animation. Most surgeons would be surprised to learn that crossover anastomoses predated direct nerve repair by nearly half a century. In 1879, the German surgeon Drobnik performed the first facial-spinal accessory anastomosis. Over the next two decades, numerous articles were written (most notably by Sir Charles Balance and Harvey Cushing) on crossovers between the FN and cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII. Although a few tentative attempts at reapproximating severed FNs took place in the first two decades of this century, it was not until 1925 that an actual suture repair of an intratemporal injury was undertaken. This feat was first accomplished by the famous hand surgeon Sterling Bunnell and shortly thereafter by the otolaryngologist Robert Martin. The evolution of FN surgery in the days predating the operating microscope is a rich tapestry of colorful personalities and clashing egos, which saw promising advances relegated to obscurity and some previously obscure techniques become progressively more promising.",Medicine,4,0,historical aspect facial nerve fn anatomy bell palsy long favorite topic otologic historian little attention paid however evolution fn surgery subject remarkably rich engaging history early th century roland italian surgeon used red hot iron coapt severed nerve ending th century ferrara another italian sutured injured nerve tortoise tendon dipped hot red wine late th century peripheral nerve suture became subject serious scientific study although ironic course event suggests evolution fn repair greatly stimulated development modern mastoid operation whereas simple mastoid operation practiced wilde others carried little risk fn injury adventuresome procedure radical mastoidectomy kessel carried much greater risk abundance iatrogenic palsy era undoubtedly much motivate surgeon seek better mean restoring facial animation surgeon would surprised learn crossover anastomosis predated direct nerve repair nearly half century german surgeon drobnik performed first facialspinal accessory anastomosis next two decade numerous article written notably sir charles balance harvey cushing crossover fn cranial nerve ix x xi xii although tentative attempt reapproximating severed fns took place first two decade century actual suture repair intratemporal injury undertaken feat first accomplished famous hand surgeon sterling bunnell shortly thereafter otolaryngologist robert martin evolution fn surgery day predating operating microscope rich tapestry colorful personality clashing ego saw promising advance relegated obscurity previously obscure technique become progressively promising

This can be achieved by antibodies blocking the cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway, either alone or in combination. The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are currently poorly understood, but evidence points to alterations that converge on the antigen presentation and interferon-γ signaling pathways.

Some of the melilite is also anomalously enriched in oxygen-16 compared with oxygen isotopes measured in other CAIs. The oxygen isotopic variation measured among the minerals (melilite, spinel, and fassaite) indicates that crystallization of the CAI started from oxygen-16-rich materials that were probably liquid droplets in the solar nebula, and oxygen isotope exchange with the surrounding oxygen-16-poor nebular gas progressed through the crystallization of the CAI.

1453,4b9e0f9b39f8dd90226382ff142b921d739c24ab,Cell Death Pathways in Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an emerging cancer therapy that uses the combination of non-toxic dyes or photosensitizers (PS) and harmless visible light to produce reactive oxygen species and destroy tumors. The PS can be localized in various organelles such as mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and plasma membranes and this sub-cellular location governs much of the signaling that occurs after PDT. There is an acute stress response that leads to changes in calcium and lipid metabolism and causes the production of cytokines and stress response mediators. Enzymes (particularly protein kinases) are activated and transcription factors are expressed. Many of the cellular responses center on mitochondria and frequently lead to induction of apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway involving caspase activation and release of cytochrome c. Certain specific proteins (such as Bcl-2) are damaged by PDT-induced oxidation thereby increasing apoptosis, and a build-up of oxidized proteins leads to an ER-stress response that may be increased by proteasome inhibition. Autophagy plays a role in either inhibiting or enhancing cell death after PDT.",Medicine,4,0,photodynamic therapy pdt emerging cancer therapy us combination nontoxic dye photosensitizers p harmless visible light produce reactive oxygen specie destroy tumor p localized various organelle mitochondrion lysosome endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus plasma membrane subcellular location governs much signaling occurs pdt acute stress response lead change calcium lipid metabolism cause production cytokine stress response mediator enzyme particularly protein kinase activated transcription factor expressed many cellular response center mitochondrion frequently lead induction apoptosis mitochondrial pathway involving caspase activation release cytochrome c certain specific protein bcl damaged pdtinduced oxidation thereby increasing apoptosis buildup oxidized protein lead erstress response may increased proteasome inhibition autophagy play role either inhibiting enhancing cell death pdt

Role of Epstein-Barr virus infection.,A 57-year-old woman receiving low dose methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed a B lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) that was initially considered as large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B cell phenotype. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) cytotoxic latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) expression was found in some large cells.

Results with currently popular techniques tend to be inartistic and aesthetically disappointing. Improved results can be achieved, however, by a technique using a medially based nasolabial turnover flap for lining with a distal extension providing the cover. Reconstruction of the ala begins by designing a nasolabial flap with its base as close as possible to the site of the proposed ala. The flap is incised to the required margins, carrying 2 to 3 mm of underlying fat; then, hinged on its base, the flap is flipped over medially like the page of a book. As the proximal flap is sutured to the lining side of the defect, the distal flap gracefully twists 90 degrees and is then folded on itself to form the external surface of the ala. The donor site is closed primarily. With this procedure, a natural-appearing and appropriately positioned ala may be reconstructed in one step, although a second procedure may be helpful to sculpture the margin or precisely position the alar base.",Medicine,4,0,nasolabial flap remains favored technique alar lateral nasal reconstruction result currently popular technique tend inartistic aesthetically disappointing improved result achieved however technique using medially based nasolabial turnover flap lining distal extension providing cover reconstruction ala begin designing nasolabial flap base close possible site proposed ala flap incised required margin carrying mm underlying fat hinged base flap flipped medially like page book proximal flap sutured lining side defect distal flap gracefully twist degree folded form external surface ala donor site closed primarily procedure naturalappearing appropriately positioned ala may reconstructed one step although second procedure may helpful sculpture margin precisely position alar base

Kraepelin, provides a solid foundation for contemporary psychiatry. Kraepelin's term, dementia praecox, was subsequently succeeded by E. Bleulev's term schizophrenia which represented a somewhat larger concept than the former. Since Bleuler's time, the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been made chiefly on the basis of psychological characteristics shown in the clinical picture rather than on the clinical course and outcome of the illness since its inception. As a result, the concept of the illness has been expanded and its boundaries have been obscured. Therefore, it seems only natural that contemporary views regarding the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are frequently in disagreement and are matters of controversy. This problemthe classification of schizophrenia was a subject matter of importance during the International Psychiatric Congress held in Zurich in 1957. The most troublesome of all diagnostic problems in our daily practice seems to be with the group of illnesses which show atypical features attributable to neither schizophrenia nor manic depressive psychosis.

However, various constraints restrict the possible mass windows to 1016–1017 g, 1020–1024 g, and 10–103 M⊙. The last possibility is contentious but of special interest in view of the recent detection of black hole mergers by LIGO/Virgo. PBHs might have important consequences and resolve various cosmological conundra even if they account for only a small fraction of the dark matter density. In particular, those larger than 103 M⊙ could generate cosmological structures through the seed or Poisson effect, thereby alleviating some problems associated with the standard cold dark matter scenario, and sufficiently large PBHs might provide seeds for the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

In some cases an apparently convincing approximation turns out to be misleading; in others a seemingly unmanageable problem turns out to have a simple answer. Peierls's intention, however, is not to treat theoretical physics as an unpredictable game in which such surprises happen at random. Instead he shows how in each case careful thought could have prepared us for the outcome. Peierls has chosen mainly problems from his own experience or that of his collaborators, often showing how classic problems can lend themselves to new insights.

Pseudo-scalars are naturally coupled to gauge fields through cF. In the presence of this coupling, gauge field quanta are copiously produced by the rolling inflaton. The produced gauge quanta, in turn, source inflaton fluctuations via inverse decay. These new cosmological perturbations add incoherently with the ``vacuum'' perturbations, and are highly nongaussian. This provides a natural mechanism to generate large nongaussianity in single or multi field slow-roll inflation. The resulting phenomenological signatures are highly distinctive: large nongaussianity of (nearly) equilateral shape, in addition to detectably large values of both the scalar spectral tilt and tensor-to-scalar ratio (both being typical of large field inflation). The WMAP bound on nongaussianity implies that the coupling c of the pseudo-scalar inflaton to any gauge field must be smaller than about 102 Mp−1.",Physics,2,0,many controlled realization chaotic inflation employ pseudoscalar axions pseudoscalars naturally coupled gauge field cf presence coupling gauge field quantum copiously produced rolling inflaton produced gauge quantum turn source inflaton fluctuation via inverse decay new cosmological perturbation add incoherently vacuum perturbation highly nongaussian provides natural mechanism generate large nongaussianity single multi field slowroll inflation resulting phenomenological signature highly distinctive large nongaussianity nearly equilateral shape addition detectably large value scalar spectral tilt tensortoscalar ratio typical large field inflation wmap bound nongaussianity implies coupling c pseudoscalar inflaton gauge field must smaller mp

This ensemble may be taken as the statistical. This enables an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics with which is associated that classical picture. Such a formulation leads, however, if developed straightforwardly according to the picture, to a theoretical scheme quite different from that of ordinary quantum mechanics. concerning the problems other than the equation of motion. Furthermore, this formulation is not applicable to Fermions when spin, or exclusion principle is taken jrlto account. Bohm's recent renewed form of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics referring to this formulation is criticized in several points. On this formulation we can construct a singular ensemble which is shown to correspond to the tranformation kernel of the wave function to infinitesimally later instant, and thus a connection between this formulation and that of Feyninan's is taken out.

Wave transience, forcing and dissipation are taken into account in a very general way. The theory makes it possible to discuss the latitudinal (y) and vertical (z) dependence of ∂ū/∂t qualitatively and calculate it directly from an approximate knowledge of the wave structure. For equatorial modes it reveals that the y profile of ∂ū/∂t is strongly dependent on the nature of the forcing or dissipation mechanism. A by-product of the theory is a far-reaching generalization of the theorems of Charney-Drazin, Dickinson and Holton on the forcing of ∂ū/∂t by conservative linear waves. Implications for the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere are discussed. Graphs of y profiles of ∂ū/∂t are given for the equatorial waves considered in the recent analysis of observational data...",Physics,3,0,abstract using new generalization eliassenpalm relation discus zonalmeanflow tendency ūt due wave stratified rotating atmosphere particular attention equatorially trapped mode wave transience forcing dissipation taken account general way theory make possible discus latitudinal vertical z dependence ūt qualitatively calculate directly approximate knowledge wave structure equatorial mode reveals profile ūt strongly dependent nature forcing dissipation mechanism byproduct theory farreaching generalization theorem charneydrazin dickinson holton forcing ūt conservative linear wave implication quasibiennial oscillation equatorial stratosphere discussed graph profile ūt given equatorial wave considered recent analysis observational data

On the other hand, the massive stars that participate in the runaway collisions lose mass by stellar winds. In this paper, we discuss new N-body simulations of massive (6.5x10^4 Msun) star clusters, in which we added upgraded recipes for stellar winds and supernova explosion at different metallicity. We follow the evolution of the principal collision product (PCP), through dynamics and stellar evolution, till it forms a stellar remnant. At solar metallicity, the mass of the final merger product spans from few solar masses up to ~30 Msun. At low metallicity (0.01-0.1 Zsun) the maximum remnant mass is ~250 Msun, in the range of IMBHs. A large fraction (~0.6) of the PCPs are not ejected from the parent star cluster and acquire stellar or black hole (BH) companions. Most of the long-lived binaries hosting a PCP are BH-BH binaries.

Clusters are easily reproduced with a steep mass spectrum of thousands of substructure clumps that closely matches the observations. However, the survival of dark matter substructure also occurs on galactic scales, leading to the remarkable result that galaxy halos appear as scaled versions of galaxy clusters. The model predicts that the virialized extent of the Milky Way's halo should contain about 500 satellites with circular velocities larger than the Draco and Ursa Minor systems, i.e., bound masses ≳108 M☉ and tidally limited sizes ≳1 kpc. The substructure clumps are on orbits that take a large fraction of them through the stellar disk, leading to significant resonant and impulsive heating.

The code makes it possible to trace the effects of mass and angular momentum loss from the binary, as well as mass transfer within the binary system. It is found that a large number of binary scenarios can be distinguished, depending on the type of binary interaction and the evolutionary stage of the supernova progenitor at the time of the interaction. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to estimate the frequencies of the occurrence of various scenarios. It is found that, because of a previous binary interaction, 15-30 percent of all massive stars (with initial masses greater than about 8 solar masses) become helium stars, and another 5 percent of all massive stars end their lives as blue supergiants rather than as red supergiants.",Physics,3,0,way binary interaction affect presupernova evolution massive close binary resulting supernova explosion investigated systematically mean henyeytype stellar evolution code modified allow application binary stellar evolution calculation code make possible trace effect mass angular momentum loss binary well mass transfer within binary system found large number binary scenario distinguished depending type binary interaction evolutionary stage supernova progenitor time interaction monte carlo simulation performed estimate frequency occurrence various scenario found previous binary interaction percent massive star initial mass greater solar mass become helium star another percent massive star end life blue supergiant rather red supergiant

It is found that increased emission originated in a photoionized low-density circumstellar gas, lost by the progenitor in its red supergiant phase. A nebular analysis reveals a large nitrogen overabundance, indicating that the gas has undergone substantial CNO processing. This suggests that the progenitor of SN 1987A lost much of its hydrogen envelope before the explosion.

The orbits present fairly large eccentricities (0:22 e 0:43). Except for HD 162020, the parent stars are metal rich compared to the Sun, as are most of the detected extra-solar planet hosts. Considerations of tidal dissipation in the short-period HD 162020 system points towards a brown-dwarf nature for the low-mass companion. HD 168443 is a multiple system with two low-mass companions being either brown dwarfs or formed simultaneously in the protoplanetary disks as superplanets. For HD 202206, the radial velocities show an additional drift revealing a further outer companion, the nature of which is still unknown. Finally, the stellar-host and orbital properties of massive planets are examined in comparison to lighter exoplanets.

Although observational estimates are available for a small proportion of PNe, based on statistical parallax and the like, such distances are very poorly determined for the majority of galactic PNe. In particular, estimates of so-called ‘statistical’ distance appear to differ by factors of ∼2.7. 
 
 
 
We point out that there is a well-defined correlation between the 5-GHz luminosity of the sources, L5, and their brightness temperatures, TB. This represents a different trend to those investigated in previous statistical analyses, and permits us to determine independent distances to a further 449 outflows. These distances are shown to be closely comparable to those determined using a TB–R correlation, providing that the latter trend is taken to be non-linear. 
 
 
 
This non-linearity in the TB–R plane has not been noted in previous analyses, and is likely responsible for the broad (and conflicting) ranges of distance that have previously been published. 
 
 
 
Finally, we point out that there is a close accord between observed trends within the L5–TB and TB–R planes, and the variation predicted through nebular evolutionary modelling. This is used to suggest that observational biases are probably modest, and that our revised distance scale is reasonably trustworthy.",Physics,2,0,distance planetary nebula pne still quite uncertain although observational estimate available small proportion pne based statistical parallax like distance poorly determined majority galactic pne particular estimate socalled statistical distance appear differ factor point welldefined correlation ghz luminosity source l brightness temperature tb represents different trend investigated previous statistical analysis permit u determine independent distance outflow distance shown closely comparable determined using tbr correlation providing latter trend taken nonlinear nonlinearity tbr plane noted previous analysis likely responsible broad conflicting range distance previously published finally point close accord observed trend within ltb tbr plane variation predicted nebular evolutionary modelling used suggest observational bias probably modest revised distance scale reasonably trustworthy

Here we investigate the shapes and relative orientations of the stars and dark matter of halos and subhalos (central and satellite) extracted from the MassiveBlack-II simulation, a state-of-the-art high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation which includes stellar and AGN feedback in a volume of $(100{h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}})^3$. We consider redshift evolution from $z=1$ to $0.06$ and mass evolution within the range of subhalo masses, $10^{10} -6.0 \times 10^{14.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$. The shapes of the dark matter distributions are generally more round than the shapes defined by stellar matter. The projected root-mean-square (RMS) ellipticity per component for stellar matter is measured to be $e_\text{rms} = 0.28$ at $z=0.3$ for $M_{subhalo}> 10^{12.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$, which compares favourably with observational measurements. We find that the shapes of stellar and dark matter are more round for less massive subhalos and at lower redshifts. By directly measuring the relative orientation of the stellar matter and dark matter of subgroups, we find that, on average, the misalignment between the two components is larger for less massive subhalos. The mean misalignment angle varies from $\sim 30^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$ for $M \sim 10^{10} - 10^{14} {h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$ and shows a weak dependence on redshift. We also compare the misalignment angles in central and satellite subhalos at fixed subhalo mass, and find that centrals are more misaligned than satellites.

In cases with enough supersymmetry, it has been possible to explicitly construct such microstates in spacetime and understand how coarse graining of non-singular, horizon-free objects can lead to an effective description as an extremal black hole. We discuss how these results arise in type II string theory on AdS5 × S5 and on AdS3 × S3 × T4 that preserve 16 and eight supercharges, respectively. For such a picture of black holes as effective geometries to extend to cases with a finite horizon area, the scale of quantum effects in gravity would have to extend well beyond the vicinity of the singularities in the effective theory.

Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory techniques, we derive three different first law relations including variations in the cosmological constant, and associated Smarr formulas that are satisfied by such spacetimes. Each first law introduces a different thermodynamic volume conjugate to the cosmological constant. We examine the relation between these thermodynamic volumes and associated geometric volumes in a number of examples, including Kerr-dS black holes in all dimensions and Kerr-Newman-dS black holes in D = 4. We also show that the Chong-Cvetic-Lu-Pope solution of D = 5 minimal supergravity, analytically continued to positive cosmological constant, describes black hole solutions of the Einstein-Chern-Simons theory and include such charged asymptotically de Sitter black holes in our analysis. In all these examples we find that the particular thermodynamic volume associated with the region between the black hole and cosmological horizons is equal to the naive geometric volume. Isoperimetric inequalities, which hold in the examples considered, are formulated for the different thermodynamic volumes and conjectured to remain valid for all asymptotically de Sitter black holes. In particular, in all examples considered, we find that for fixed volume of the observable universe, the entropy is increased by adding black holes.

These data turn this object into one of the most peculiar SNe IIP ever studied. The early light curve of SN 2007od is similar to that of a bright IIP, with a short plateau, a bright peak (MV=−18 mag), but a very faint late-time optical light curve. However, with the inclusion of mid-IR observations during the radioactive tail, we derive an ejected mass of 56Ni of M(56Ni) ∼2 × 10−2 M⊙. By modelling the bolometric light curve, ejecta expansion velocities and blackbody temperature, we estimate a total ejected mass of 5–7.5 M⊙ with a kinetic energy of at least 0.5 × 1051 erg. The early spectra reveal a boxy Hα profile and high-velocity features of the Balmer series that suggest the possible interaction of the ejecta with a close circumstellar matter (CSM). The interaction with the CSM and the presence of dust formed inside the ejecta are evident in the late-time spectra. The episodes of mass-loss shortly before explosion, the bright plateau, the relatively small amount of 56Ni and the faint [O i] emission observed in the nebular spectra are consistent with a super-asymptotic giant branch progenitor (M∼ 9.7–11 M⊙).",Physics,3,0,ultraviolet optical nearinfrared observation type iip supernova sn od covering maximum light late phase allow detailed investigation different physical phenomenon expanding ejecta data turn object one peculiar sne iip ever studied early light curve sn od similar bright iip short plateau bright peak mv mag faint latetime optical light curve however inclusion midir observation radioactive tail derive ejected mass ni mni modelling bolometric light curve ejecta expansion velocity blackbody temperature estimate total ejected mass kinetic energy least erg early spectrum reveal boxy hα profile highvelocity feature balmer series suggest possible interaction ejecta close circumstellar matter csm interaction csm presence dust formed inside ejecta evident latetime spectrum episode massloss shortly explosion bright plateau relatively small amount ni faint emission observed nebular spectrum consistent superasymptotic giant branch progenitor

In agreement with previous works, we find that accretion during the radiation-dominated era does not lead to a significant mass increase. However, during matter domination, PBHs may grow by up to 2 orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition of large dark matter halos. We discuss the possibility of PBHs being an important component in dark matter halos of galaxies, as well as their potential to explain the ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) observed in nearby galactic disks. We point out that although PBHs are ruled out as the dominant component of dark matter, there is still a great deal of parameter space that is open to their playing a role in the modern-day universe. For example, a primordial halo population of PBHs each at 102.5 M☉, making up 0.1% of the dark matter, grows to 104.5 M☉ via the accumulation of dark matter halos and accounts for ~10% of the dark matter mass by a redshift of z ≈ 30.

 We present a new cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation for galaxy formation: TNG50, the third and final instalment of the IllustrisTNG project. TNG50 evolves 2 × 21603 dark matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of $8.5\times 10^4\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ and an average cell size of 70–140 pc in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples ∼700 (6500) galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{10} \, (10^8)\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ at $z$ = 1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 ≲ $z$ ≲ 6). We quantify their sizes, disc heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational versus dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by $\rm H\,\alpha$ light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with ≲300-pc disc heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disc-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of $10^{9-11.5}\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported discs for most cosmic epochs (Vrot/σ > 2–3, $z$ ≲ 5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs ($z$ ≳ 1.5).

An important consequence of this geometry is that no accelerated flows are predicted across the dayside magnetopause. Acceleration owing to merging acts in opposition to the magnetosheath flow at the merging point and produces the variably directed, slower-than-magnetosheath flows observed in the entry layer. Another consequence of the merging geometry is that much of the time closed field lines constitute the subsolar region of the magnetopause.

The ratio ranged from 0.577 to 0.921 at 1362 A and 0.681 to 0.916 at 1769 A with the spread in the ratio arising mainly from uncertainties in the sky background. In order to analyze these images, a model utilizing Monte Carlo techniques to describe radiative transfer in a spherical nebula with asymmetrically distributed stars was developed by elaborating on previous work by Witt. This model was used to determine the range of albedos reproducing the observed nebular-to-stellar flux ratios while allowing the scattering phase function asymmetry to vary between 0.0 and 0.8.

We wish to determine whether this planet, which is in a 22 day orbit and receives 2700 times as much incident flux as Jupiter, is as dense as Jupiter or rarefied like inflated hot Jupiters. KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the W. M. Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture. We report the properties of KOI-94b (MP = 10.5 ± 4.6 M⊕, RP = 1.71 ± 0.16 R⊕, P = 3.74 days), KOI-94c (MP =  M⊕, RP = 4.32 ± 0.41 R⊕, P = 10.4 days), KOI-94d (MP = 106 ± 11 M⊕, RP = 11.27 ± 1.06 R⊕, P = 22.3 days), and KOI-94e (MP =  M⊕, RP = 6.56 ± 0.62 R⊕, P = 54.3 days). The radial velocity analyses of KOI-94b and KOI-94e offer marginal (>2σ) mass detections, whereas the observations of KOI-94c offer only an upper limit to its mass. Using the KOI-94 system and other planets with published values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35 with MP < 150 M⊕), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanets that relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few Earth masses up to 13 Jupiter masses: (RP/R⊕) = 1.78(MP/M⊕)0.53(F/erg s−1 cm−2)−0.03 for MP < 150 M⊕, and RP/R⊕ = 2.45(MP/M⊕)−0.039(F/erg s−1 cm−2)0.094 for MP > 150 M⊕.

Observations obtained in the infrared reveal a source offset by a few arcsec from the apex of the fan, which is identified with the illuminating star. Radial velocities of CO emission indicate that PV Cep is at the same distance as NGC 7023, and independent estimates lead to an estimated value of 500 pc.

In a cuspy CDM halo the globulars would sink to thecentre from their current positions within a few Gyrs, presenting a puzzle as to whythey survive undigested at the present epoch. We show that a solution to this timingproblem is to adopt a cored dark matter halo.

Weconclude that the Fornax dwarf spheroidal has a shallow inner density proﬁle with acore radius constrained by the observed positions of its globular clusters.

A connection is given between the fractal dimensions of finite-dimensional chaotic systems and the anomalous dimensions in stochastic systems near criticality. The effect of additional random noise on stochastic systems will be delineated in terms of the crossover phenomenon between competing criticalities.

For a pressureless collapsing universe in loop quantum cosmology, the predicted power spectrum of the scalar perturbations after the bounce is scale-invariant and the tensor to scalar ratio is negligibly small. A slight red tilt can be given to the scale-invariance of the scalar perturbations by a scalar field whose equation of state is P = −ρ, where is a small positive number. Then, the power spectrum for tensor perturbations is also almost scale-invariant with the same red tilt as the scalar perturbations, and the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be r ≈ 9 × 10−4. Finally, for the predicted amplitude of the scalar perturbations to agree with observations, the critical density in loop quantum cosmology must be of the order ρc ~ 10−9ρPl.",Physics,3,0,matter bounce scenario dustdominated contracting spacetime generates scaleinvariant perturbation assuming nonsingular bouncing cosmology propagate expanding branch set appropriate initial condition radiationdominated era since scenario depends presence bounce seems appropriate consider context loop quantum cosmology bouncing universe naturally arises pressureless collapsing universe loop quantum cosmology predicted power spectrum scalar perturbation bounce scaleinvariant tensor scalar ratio negligibly small slight red tilt given scaleinvariance scalar perturbation scalar field whose equation state p ρ small positive number power spectrum tensor perturbation also almost scaleinvariant red tilt scalar perturbation tensor scalar ratio expected r finally predicted amplitude scalar perturbation agree observation critical density loop quantum cosmology must order ρc ρpl

As recently highlighted by Boylan-Kolchin et al., this discrepancy implies that the majority of the most massive subhaloes within a cold dark matter galactic halo are too concentrated to be consistent with the kinematic data for the bright Milky Way satellites. Here we show that no such discrepancy exists if haloes are made of warm rather than cold dark matter because these haloes are less concentrated on account of their typically later formation epochs.

These transitions are particularly interesting for, in contrast to their classical finite-temperature counterparts, their dynamic and static critical behaviors are intimately intertwined. Considerable insight is gained by considering the path-integral description of the quantum statistical mechanics of such systems, which takes the form of the classical statistical mechanics of a system in which time appears as an extra dimension. In particular, this allows the deduction of scaling forms for the finite-temperature behavior, which turns out to be described by the theory of finite-size scaling. It also leads naturally to the notion of a temperature-dependent dephasing length that governs the crossover between quantum and classical fluctuations. Using these ideas, a scaling analysis of experiments on Josephson-junction arrays and quantum-Hall-effect systems is presented.",Physics,4,0,quantum system undergo continuous phase transition absolute zero temperature parameter entering hamiltonian varied transition particularly interesting contrast classical finitetemperature counterpart dynamic static critical behavior intimately intertwined considerable insight gained considering pathintegral description quantum statistical mechanic system take form classical statistical mechanic system time appears extra dimension particular allows deduction scaling form finitetemperature behavior turn described theory finitesize scaling also lead naturally notion temperaturedependent dephasing length governs crossover quantum classical fluctuation using idea scaling analysis experiment josephsonjunction array quantumhalleffect system presented

1646,9ef2595d946dbcfcd985f9cdf17b66bcd1fc13a1,Possible evidence for dark matter annihilations from the excess microwave emission around the center of the Galaxy seen by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe,"The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) experiment has revealed an excess of microwave emission from the region around the center of our Galaxy. It has been suggested that this signal, known as the ""WMAP haze,"" could be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons generated in dark matter annihilations. In this article, we revisit this possibility. We find that the angular distribution of the WMAP haze matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density profile, p(r) α r -1.2 in the inner kiloparsecs. Comparing the intensity in different WMAP frequency bands, we find that a wide range of possible weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze for a WIMP with a mass in the 100 GeV to multi-TeV range. Most interestingly, we find that to generate the observed intensity of the haze, the dark matter annihilation cross section is required to be approximately equal to the value needed for a thermal relic, συ ∼ 3 X 10 -26 cm 3 /s. No boost factors are required.

We propose a model where molecular clouds condense from low-entropy gas caught in the updraft of rising X-ray bubbles. The low-entropy gas becomes thermally unstable when it is lifted to an altitude where its cooling time is shorter than the time required to fall to its equilibrium location in the galaxy, i.e., . The infall speed of a cloud is bounded by the lesser of its free-fall and terminal speeds, so that the infall time here can exceed the free-fall time by a significant factor. This mechanism is motivated by Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations revealing molecular clouds lying in the wakes of rising X-ray bubbles with velocities well below their free-fall speeds. Our mechanism would provide cold gas needed to fuel a feedback loop while stabilizing the atmosphere on larger scales.

As the planet migrates in the disk from beyond the snow line toward a multi-day period orbit, the formed and forming moons become unstable as the planet's sphere of influence shrinks. Disk-driven migration is faster than the moons’ tidal orbital evolution. Moons are eventually ejected from around close-in exoplanets or forced into collision with them before tides from the planet affect their orbits. If moons are detected around close-in exoplanets, they are unlikely to have been formed in situ, instead they were captured from the protoplanetary disk on retrograde orbits around the planets.",Physics,3,0,show fate moon closein giant planet mainly determined migration history planet protoplanetary disk planet migrates disk beyond snow line toward multiday period orbit formed forming moon become unstable planet sphere influence shrink diskdriven migration faster moon tidal orbital evolution moon eventually ejected around closein exoplanets forced collision tide planet affect orbit moon detected around closein exoplanets unlikely formed situ instead captured protoplanetary disk retrograde orbit around planet

The CoRoT space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12 000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search for transiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007. Deep transit signals can be detected quickly in the “alarm-mode” in parallel to the ongoing target field monitoring. CoRoT’s first planets have been detected in this mode. Methods. The CoRoT raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals, outliers, and low-frequency stellar signals. The phase folded lightcurve is used to fit the transit signal and derive the main planetary parameters. Radial velocity follow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive the planet mass. Results. We report the detection of CoRoT-5b, detected during observations of the LRa01 field, the first long-duration field in the galactic anticenter direction.

If the mass loss occurs in a collapsing protosystem with uniform density, no angular momentum, and relatively little radiation of energy, the minimum fractional mass loss required for dissociation is reduced to ..delta..M/M/sub 0/=R/sub c//(2R/sub 0/). Here R/sub c/ is the radius of the system when the mass loss occurs and R/sub 0/ is the radius it would have attained after virialization if no mass loss had occurred. A situation of this type is expected in a protocluster that forms from a collapsing interstellar cloud. The stars form when the protocluster is near its point of maximum compression. Any newly formed OB stars produce an H II region whose expansion dissipates the residual gas in the protosystem before the system reaches dynamical equilibrium. The angular momentum of the protosystem and any radiative losses from it prior to star formation will tend to stabilize it against mass loss by limiting the compression factor 2R/sub 0//R/sub c/. The angular momentum places a lower limit on the radius R/sub c/, and the radiative losses reduce the final equilibrium radius R/submore » 0/. However, observed infantile clusters such as the Trapezium are sufficiently compressed at the present time that a loss of as little as 10% of their mass is sufficient to dissociate them. This may explain why most young stars are not located in gravitationally bound clusters. If the protocluster gas contains an appreciable magnetic field, the compression of this field in the collapsing cloud drains off some of the gravitational energy that otherwise would go into the kinetic energy of collapse. This increases the minimum mass loss required to dissociate the system, but it is still very small for most systems.« less",Physics,4,0,half mass virialized system lost le one dynamical crossing time system dissocites mass loss occurs collapsing protosystem uniform density angular momentum relatively little radiation energy minimum fractional mass loss required dissociation reduced deltammsub rsub crsub rsub c radius system mass loss occurs rsub radius would attained virialization mass loss occurred situation type expected protocluster form collapsing interstellar cloud star form protocluster near point maximum compression newly formed ob star produce h ii region whose expansion dissipates residual gas protosystem system reach dynamical equilibrium angular momentum protosystem radiative loss prior star formation tend stabilize mass loss limiting compression factor rsub rsub c angular momentum place lower limit radius rsub c radiative loss reduce final equilibrium radius rsubmore however observed infantile cluster trapezium sufficiently compressed present time loss little mass sufficient dissociate may explain young star located gravitationally bound cluster protocluster gas contains appreciable magnetic field compression field collapsing cloud drain gravitational energy otherwise would go kinetic energy collapse increase minimum mass loss required dissociate system still small system le

These galaxies were selected to be detectable with WFPC2 in one orbit, and cover a wide range of Hubble types and inclinations. The mid-UV spans the gap between our groundbased optical/NIR images and far-UV images available from the Astro/UIT missions. Our first qualitative results are: 
(1) Early-type galaxies show a significant decrease in surface brightness going from the red to the mid-UV, and in some cases the presence of dust lanes. Some galaxies would be classified different when viewed in the mid-UV, some become dominated by a blue nuclear feature or point source. 
(2) Half of the mid-type spiral and star-forming galaxies appear as a later morphological type in the mid-UV, as Astro/UIT also found in the far-UV. Some- times these differences are dramatic. The mid-UV images show a considerable range in the scale and surface brightness of individual star-forming regions. Almost all mid-type spirals have their small bulges bi-sected by a dust-lane. 
(3) Most of the heterogeneous subset of late-type, irregular, peculiar, and merging galaxies display F300W morphologies that are similar to those seen in F814W, but with differences due to recognizable dust features absorbing the bluer light, and due to UV-bright hot stars, star-clusters, and star-forming ridges.

In particular, the UV line intensities observed in the jet appear variable on a time scale of about 1.5 yr. A new accretion disk model is proposed that explains the kinematic and ionization properties of discrete components which comprise the jet emission nebulosity, the appearance of the jet in the 1980s, and morphology that uniquely characterizes the R Aquarii system at radio, optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. 52 references.",Physics,3,0,ultraviolet spectrum range indicate extended nebular feature resemble jet peculiar variable r aquarii pec increased excitation emission property compact h ii region surround unresolved binary extended nebular jet analyzed lowresolution iue spectrum region particular uv line intensity observed jet appear variable time scale yr new accretion disk model proposed explains kinematic ionization property discrete component comprise jet emission nebulosity appearance jet morphology uniquely characterizes r aquarii system radio optical uv xray wavelength reference

In the dual field theories these excitations are described by free fermions. Configurations which are dual to arbitrary droplets of free fermions in phase space correspond to smooth geometries with no horizons. In fact, the ten dimensional geometry contains a special two dimensional plane which can be identified with the phase space of the free fermion system. The topology of the resulting geometries depends only on the topology of the collection of droplets on this plane. These solutions also give a very explicit realization of the geometric transitions between branes and fluxes. We also describe all 1/2 BPS excitations of plane wave geometries. The problem of finding the explicit geometries is reduced to solving a Laplace (or Toda) equation with simple boundary conditions. We present a large class of explicit solutions. In addition, we are led to a rather general class of AdS5 compactifications of M-theory preserving = 2 superconformal symmetry.

Here we report measurements of rest-frame optical light and calculations of stellar mass at high redshift based on an infrared-selected sample of galaxies from the Hubble Deep Field-North. The bright envelope of rest-frame B-band galaxy luminosities is similar in the range 0 < z < 3, and the comoving luminosity density is constant to within a factor of 3 over that redshift range. However, galaxies at higher redshifts are bluer, and stellar population modeling indicates that they had significantly lower mass-to-light ratios than those of present-day L* galaxies. This leads to a global stellar mass density, Ω* , that rises with time from z = 3 to the present. This measurement essentially traces the integral of the cosmic star formation history that has been the subject of previous investigations. Between 50% and 75% of the present-day stellar mass density had formed by z ~ 1, but at z ≈ 2.7 we find that only 3%-14% of today's stars were present. This increase in Ω* with time is broadly consistent with observations of the evolving global star formation rate, once dust extinction is taken into account, but is steeper at 1 < z < 3 than predicted by some recent semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The observations appear to be inconsistent with scenarios in which the bulk of stars in present-day galactic spheroids formed at z ≫ 2.",Physics,4,0,buildup stellar mass galaxy consequence past star formation merging history report measurement restframe optical light calculation stellar mass high redshift based infraredselected sample galaxy hubble deep fieldnorth bright envelope restframe bband galaxy luminosity similar range z comoving luminosity density constant within factor redshift range however galaxy higher redshift bluer stellar population modeling indicates significantly lower masstolight ratio presentday l galaxy lead global stellar mass density ω rise time z present measurement essentially trace integral cosmic star formation history subject previous investigation presentday stellar mass density formed z z find today star present increase ω time broadly consistent observation evolving global star formation rate dust extinction taken account steeper z predicted recent semianalytic model galaxy formation observation appear inconsistent scenario bulk star presentday galactic spheroid formed z

Regardless of their mass, halos are nearly isothermal over a large range in radius, but significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r -2 in the outer regions. The characteristic overdensity of a halo correlates strongly with halo mass in a manner consistent with the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Matching the shape of the rotation curves of disk galaxies with this halo structure requires (i) disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity, (ii) halo circular velocities to be systematically lower than the disk rotation speed, and (iii) that the masses of halos surrounding bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity.

The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has verified that this observation is consistent with General Relativity, constraining the presence of parametric anomalies in the signal. This paper expands this analysis to a larger class of anomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard theoretical physics mechanisms that would affect the signal. We find that GW150914 constrains a plethora of mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational waves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into large extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, the speed of gravity, a modified dispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence principle. Unlike other observations that limit these mechanisms, GW150914 is a direct probe of dynamical strong-field gravity and gravitational wave propagation. We also show that GW150914 constrains the properties of exotic compact object alternatives to Kerr black holes. The true potential for GW150914 to both constrain exotic objects and physics beyond General Relativity is limited by the lack of understanding of the dynamical strong field in almost all modified gravity theories. GW150914 thus raises the bar that these theories must pass, both in terms of having a sound theoretical underpinning, and the minimal level to which the corresponding equations of motion must be solved in binary coalescences. We conclude with a discussion of additional inferences that can be drawn from smaller-confidence observations, such as the LVT151012 trigger and electromagnetic counterparts to GW150914, the latter of which would produce dramatic constraints on the speed of gravity and gravitational Lorentz violation.",Physics,1,0,gravitationalwave observation gw advanced ligo provides first opportunity learn physic extreme gravity coalescing binary black hole ligovirgo collaboration verified observation consistent general relativity constraining presence parametric anomaly signal paper expands analysis larger class anomaly highlighting inference drawn nonstandard theoretical physic mechanism would affect signal find gw constrains plethora mechanism associated generation propagation gravitational wave including activation scalar field gravitational leakage large extra dimension variability newton constant speed gravity modified dispersion relation gravitational lorentz violation strong equivalence principle unlike observation limit mechanism gw direct probe dynamical strongfield gravity gravitational wave propagation also show gw constrains property exotic compact object alternative kerr black hole true potential gw constrain exotic object physic beyond general relativity limited lack understanding dynamical strong field almost modified gravity theory gw thus raise bar theory must pas term sound theoretical underpinning minimal level corresponding equation motion must solved binary coalescence conclude discussion additional inference drawn smallerconfidence observation lvt trigger electromagnetic counterpart gw latter would produce dramatic constraint speed gravity gravitational lorentz violation

Relationalists deny this, claiming that spacetime enjoys only a derivative existence. I begin by describing how the Galilean symmetries of Newtonian physics tell against both Newton's brand of substantivalism and the most obvious relationalist alternative. I then review the (now) obvious substantivalist response to the problem, which is to ditch substantival space for substantival spacetime. The resulting position has many affinities with what are arguably the most natural interpretations of special and general relativity. I move on to consider and reject two recent antisubstantivalist lines of thought. The interim conclusion is that the best argument for relationalism is an appeal to Ockham's razor. However, for this to be successful there must be genuine relationalist theories that share the theoretical virtues of their substantivalist rivals but without the additional ontological commitment. The bulk of the paper is therefore an investigation of various concrete relationalist proposals. I distinguish three options for the relationalist in the face of the success of Galilean invariant physics and trace how these generalise to relativistic physics. One of the options (Barbour's Machian approach to dynamics) is particularly promising but, since its basic objects end up being spacetime points, this does not help the prospects of relationalism as traditionally conceived. I end with some reflections on the fate of substantivalism in the aftermath of the Hole Argument, concluding that we have as yet to be given good reasons to abandon the natural, substantivalist interpretation of current physics.",Physics,2,0,substantivalists believe spacetime part fundamental constituent reality relationalists deny claiming spacetime enjoys derivative existence begin describing galilean symmetry newtonian physic tell newton brand substantivalism obvious relationalist alternative review obvious substantivalist response problem ditch substantival space substantival spacetime resulting position many affinity arguably natural interpretation special general relativity move consider reject two recent antisubstantivalist line thought interim conclusion best argument relationalism appeal ockham razor however successful must genuine relationalist theory share theoretical virtue substantivalist rival without additional ontological commitment bulk paper therefore investigation various concrete relationalist proposal distinguish three option relationalist face success galilean invariant physic trace generalise relativistic physic one option barbours machian approach dynamic particularly promising since basic object end spacetime point help prospect relationalism traditionally conceived end reflection fate substantivalism aftermath hole argument concluding yet given good reason abandon natural substantivalist interpretation current physic

The two outstanding parameters in the Standard Model dealt with during the MITP scientific program are the strong coupling constant s and the top-quark mass mt. Lacking knowledge on the value of those fundamental constants is often the limiting factor in the accuracy of theoretical predictions.

For a scalar potential of the form $V(\ensuremath{\varphi})=a{\ensuremath{\varphi}}^{n}$, the energy density of the scalar-field oscillations decreases as ${R}^{\ensuremath{-}\frac{6n}{(n+2)}}$ when the oscillations are rapid compared to the expansion rate ($R=\mathrm{cosmic}\mathrm{scale}\mathrm{factor}$). We also investigate the effect of higher-order terms in the potential perturbatively, and analyze the decay of the coherent field oscillations due to quantum particle creation.",Physics,4,0,motivated cosmological importance coherent classical scalarfield oscillation context invisible axion new inflationaryuniverse scenario analyze general classical evolution scalar field isotropic homogeneous cosmology scalar potential form vensuremathvarphiaensuremathvarphin energy density scalarfield oscillation decrease rensuremathfracnn oscillation rapid compared expansion rate rmathrmcosmicmathrmscalemathrmfactor also investigate effect higherorder term potential perturbatively analyze decay coherent field oscillation due quantum particle creation

However, self-consistently linking a planetary system across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant branch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted architectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and perform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed planetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting trends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial incursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the dispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may sustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain observations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than any variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the white dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and systems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase remain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions. We list the key dynamical features of each simulation individually as a potential guide for upcoming discoveries.",Physics,2,0,know planetary system common around white dwarf around mainsequence star however selfconsistently linking planetary system across two phase stellar evolution violent giant branch pose computational challenge previous study restricted architecture equalmass planet remove constraint perform numerical integration hubble time gyr packed planetary system unequalmass planet characterize resulting trend function planet order mass find intrusive radial incursion vicinity white dwarf become le likely dispersion amongst planet mass increase orbital meandering may sustain sufficiently dynamic environment around white dwarf explain observation dependent presence terrestrialmass planet variation planetary mass triggering unpacking instability white dwarf phase comparably easy system unequalmass planet system equalmass planet instability giant branch phase remain rare require finetuning initial condition list key dynamical feature simulation individually potential guide upcoming discovery

Consequently, this model cannot be of any general applicability, since it is inconsistent with the basic physics of the problem, which requires that the description of the turbulence be the same in all inertial frames of reference.

It responded to this by losing axial symmetry, growing spiral arms that had the capacity to tidally redistribute disk mass (inward) and angular momentum (outward) and prevent further increase in the disk/protosun mass ratio. The spiral arms (density waves) rotated differently than the substance of the nebula, and in some parts of the disk, nebular material may have encountered the arms at supersonic velocities. The disk gas, and solid particles entrained in it, would have been heated to some degree when they passed through shock fronts at the leading edges of the spiral arms. The present paper proposes this was the energetic nebular setting or environment that has long been sought, in which the material now in the planets and chondritic meteorites was thermally processed.",Physics,3,0,widely held view nebular evolution interstellar material collapsing onto disk latter grew mass point gravitational instability responded losing axial symmetry growing spiral arm capacity tidally redistribute disk mass inward angular momentum outward prevent increase diskprotosun mass ratio spiral arm density wave rotated differently substance nebula part disk nebular material may encountered arm supersonic velocity disk gas solid particle entrained would heated degree passed shock front leading edge spiral arm present paper proposes energetic nebular setting environment long sought material planet chondritic meteorite thermally processed

These additional variables were to restore to the theory causality and locality [2]. In this note that idea will be formulated mathematically and shown to be incompatible with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. It is the requirement of locality, or more precisely that the result of a measurement on one system be unaffected by operations on a distant system with which it has interacted in the past, that creates the essential difficulty. There have been attempts [3] to show that even without such a separability or locality requirement no ""hidden variable"" interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible. These attempts have been examined elsewhere [4] and found wanting. Moreover, a hidden variable interpretation of elementary quantum theory [5] has been explicitly constructed. That particular interpretation has indeed a grossly nonlocal structure. This is characteristic, according to the result to be proved here, of any such theory which reproduces exactly the quantum mechanical predictions.",Physics,3,0,paradox einstein podolsky rosen advanced argument quantum mechanic could complete theory supplemented additional variable additional variable restore theory causality locality note idea formulated mathematically shown incompatible statistical prediction quantum mechanic requirement locality precisely result measurement one system unaffected operation distant system interacted past creates essential difficulty attempt show even without separability locality requirement hidden variable interpretation quantum mechanic possible attempt examined elsewhere found wanting moreover hidden variable interpretation elementary quantum theory explicitly constructed particular interpretation indeed grossly nonlocal structure characteristic according result proved theory reproduces exactly quantum mechanical prediction

Commonly applied to the position and momentum of a particle, the principle states that the more precisely the position is known the more uncertain the momentum is and vice versa. This is contrary to classical Newtonian physics which holds all variables of particles to be measurable to an arbitrary uncertainty given good enough equipment. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental theory in quantum mechanics that defines why a scientist cannot measure multiple quantum variables simultaneously. Until the dawn of quantum mechanics, it was held as a fact that all variables of an object could be known to exact precision simultaneously for a given moment. Newtonian physics placed no limits on how better procedures and techniques could reduce measurement uncertainty so that it was conceivable that with proper care and accuracy all information could be defined. Heisenberg made the bold proposition that there is a lower limit to this precision making our knowledge of a particle inherently uncertain.",Physics,4,0,heisenberg uncertainty principle state inherent uncertainty act measuring variable particle commonly applied position momentum particle principle state precisely position known uncertain momentum vice versa contrary classical newtonian physic hold variable particle measurable arbitrary uncertainty given good enough equipment heisenberg uncertainty principle fundamental theory quantum mechanic defines scientist measure multiple quantum variable simultaneously dawn quantum mechanic held fact variable object could known exact precision simultaneously given moment newtonian physic placed limit better procedure technique could reduce measurement uncertainty conceivable proper care accuracy information could defined heisenberg made bold proposition lower limit precision making knowledge particle inherently uncertain

SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects are included explicitly. Our results are compared with those of the traditional meson cloud approach in which pions are coupled to the nucleon. The pionic dressing of the constituent quarks explains the experimentally observed violation of the Gottfried Sum Rule and leads to an enhanced nonperturbative sea of quark-antiquark pairs in the constituent quark and consequently in the nucleon. We find 2.5 times more pions and 10-15 times more kaons in the nucleon than in the traditional picture.,Physics,4,0,discus dressing constituent quark pseudoscalar meson cloud within effective chiral quark model su flavor symmetry breaking effect included explicitly result compared traditional meson cloud approach pion coupled nucleon pionic dressing constituent quark explains experimentally observed violation gottfried sum rule lead enhanced nonperturbative sea quarkantiquark pair constituent quark consequently nucleon find time pion time kaon nucleon traditional picture

However, isotopic anomalies observed in meteorites bear evidence of incomplete mixing in the early solar system. High-precision thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) now enables the determination of isotopic anomalies as small as 12 parts per million in the neutron-rich isotope 54Cr. Here, we report systematic deficits in 54Cr relative to Earth in differentiated molten planetesimals (the parent bodies of eucrites, diogenites, mesosiderites, pallasites, angrites, and Mars) and even in some chondritic material (ordinary chondrites). In combination with variable 54Cr excesses in the carbonaceous chondrites, this implies that at least two nebular reservoirs coexisted for differentiated and chondritic bodies. Preservation of the 54Cr heterogeneity in space and time (several million years) motivates us to speculate that late stellar input(s) could have been significant contributions to inner nebula Cr reservoirs or that the 54Cr cosmic memory was well preserved by the mineralogy of the carriers.

1735,eaf40195e698e641a0abce6b116a3bf6c9aace42,"Evolution of Massive Stars, Mass Loss and Winds","In the present paper we review some basic facts regarding the similarities and differences between Galactic planetary nebulae (PN) and Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) nebulae within the scope of stellar mass-loss history and its subsequent impact on the nebular dynamics and morphology. The case of planetary nebulae with [WR] nucleus, which allows one to perform a more direct comparison with WR nebulae, is emphasized. In particular, we review selected studies on the PN NGC 40 and on the WR nebula M 1-67. We describe the apparently ubiquitous turbulentlike phenomena originating in WR/[WR] stellar atmospheres and the surrounding nebulae, and discuss the possible impact of turbulence on ejected nebula studies. The properties of turbulence observed in ejected nebulae (apparently supersonic) are at odds with the ones related to Kolmogorov’s subsonic, incompressible turbulence. The large compressibility of the nebular gases and the possible multiplicity of turbulence energy sources are likely the main explanations for that difference. The Universal Multifractal approach of Lovejoy & Schertzer is presented and constitutes a physically realistic and natural way of modeling and quantifying nebular turbulence data with only three independent parameters, including the key C1 intermittence parameter. 1 McGill University, Ernest Rutherford Physics Building, 3600 University St., Montreal, Quebec, H3A 2T8, Canada, e-mail: gyves@physics.mcgill.ca 2 Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg, UMR 7550, 11 rue de l’Universite, 67000 Strasbourg, France, e-mail: acker@newb6.u-strasbg.fr c © EAS, EDP Sciences 2004 DOI: 10.1051/eas:2004059 318 Evolution of Massive Stars, Mass Loss and Winds",Physics,4,0,present paper review basic fact regarding similarity difference galactic planetary nebula pn galactic wolfrayet wr nebula within scope stellar massloss history subsequent impact nebular dynamic morphology case planetary nebula wr nucleus allows one perform direct comparison wr nebula emphasized particular review selected study pn ngc wr nebula describe apparently ubiquitous turbulentlike phenomenon originating wrwr stellar atmosphere surrounding nebula discus possible impact turbulence ejected nebula study property turbulence observed ejected nebula apparently supersonic odds one related kolmogorovs subsonic incompressible turbulence large compressibility nebular gas possible multiplicity turbulence energy source likely main explanation difference universal multifractal approach lovejoy schertzer presented constitutes physically realistic natural way modeling quantifying nebular turbulence data three independent parameter including key c intermittence parameter mcgill university ernest rutherford physic building university st montreal quebec ha canada email gyvesphysicsmcgillca observatoire astronomique de strasbourg umr rue de luniversite strasbourg france email ackernewbustrasbgfr c ea edp science doi ea evolution massive star mass loss wind

It is the most variable photometric feature associated with old stellar populations. Recent observational and theoretical evidence shows that it is produced mainly by low-mass, small-envelope, helium-burning stars in extreme horizontal branch and subsequent phases of evolution. These are probably descendants of the dominant, metal rich population of the galaxies. Their lifetime UV outputs are remarkably sensitive to their physical properties and hence to the age and the helium and metal abundances of their parents. UV spectra are therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics of old stellar populations, although their calibration requires a much improved understanding of giant branch mass loss, helium enrichment, and atmospheric diffusion.",Physics,3,0,abstract farultraviolet radiation ubiquitous unanticipated phenomenon elliptical galaxy earlytype spiral bulge variable photometric feature associated old stellar population recent observational theoretical evidence show produced mainly lowmass smallenvelope heliumburning star extreme horizontal branch subsequent phase evolution probably descendant dominant metal rich population galaxy lifetime uv output remarkably sensitive physical property hence age helium metal abundance parent uv spectrum therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics old stellar population although calibration requires much improved understanding giant branch mass loss helium enrichment atmospheric diffusion

These instabilities constitute a fascinating nonlinear system where fluid and kinetic nonlinearities can appear on an equal footing. In addition to basic science, Alfven instabilities are of practical importance, as the expulsion of energetic particles can damage the walls of a confinement device. Because of rapid dispersion, shear Alfven waves that are part of the continuous spectrum are rarely destabilized. However, because the index of refraction is periodic in toroidally confined plasmas, gaps appear in the continuous spectrum. At spatial locations where the radial group velocity vanishes, weakly damped discrete modes appear in these gaps. These eigenmodes are of two types. One type is associated with frequency crossings of counterpropagating waves; the toroidal Alfven eigenmode is a prominent example.

Of particular importance are the L- and M-band atmospheric windows (3–5 μm), which are the longest wavelengths currently accessible to ground-based, high-contrast imagers. We present binocular LBT adaptive optics (AO) images of the HR 8799 planetary system in six narrow-band filters from 3 to 4 μm, and a Magellan AO image of the 2M1207 planetary system in a broader 3.3 μm band. These systems encompass the five known exoplanets with luminosities consistent with L → T transition brown dwarfs. Our results show that the exoplanets are brighter and have shallower spectral slopes than equivalent temperature brown dwarfs in a wavelength range that contains the methane fundamental absorption feature (spanned by the narrow-band filters and encompassed by the broader 3.3 μm filter). For 2M1207 b, we find that thick clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry caused by vertical mixing can explain the object's appearance.

These were detected as part of our Hα survey of Orion with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Several of the disks show bipolar reflection nebulae, microjets, or pronounced temporal variability of their central stars. The relatively large fraction of bipolar reflection nebulae and microjets in our sample may be a selection effect caused by the faint nebular background far from the Trapezium. Two disks in our sample are large and particularly noteworthy: A nearly edge-on disk, d216-0939, is located several arcminutes northwest of M43 and resembles the famous HH 30 disk/jet system in Taurus. It drives the 0.15 pc long bipolar outflow HH 667 and exhibits a remarkable asymmetric reflection nebula caused by the tilt of the flared disk. With a diameter of ∼2.″6 (1200 AU), d216-0939 is as large as the giant edge-on silhouette disk d114-426 in the core of the Orion Nebula. The large disk d253-1536 is located in a binary system embedded within an externally ionized giant proplyd in M43. The disk exhibits distortions that we attribute to tidal interactions with the companion star. The bipolar jet HH 668 emerges from the proplyd ionization front in a direction orthogonal to the disk and can be traced to the young star embedded within it. A bow shock lies 54″ south of this binary system along the outflow axis.

We take the typical parameters of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and the Trapezium Cluster conditions. The photoionizing flux from the central source is assumed to arise from both the quiescent star and accretion shocks at the base of stellar magnetospheric columns, along which material from the disk accretes. The accretion flux is calculated self-consistently from the accretion mass-loss rate. We find that the disk cannot be entirely removed using only viscous evolution and photoionization from the disk-star accretion shock. However, when FUV photoevaporation by external massive stars is included, the disk is removed in 106-107 yr, and when EUV photoevaporation by external massive stars is included, the disk is removed in 105-106 yr. An intriguing feature of photoevaporation by the central star is the formation of a gap in the disk at late stages of the disk evolution. As the gap starts forming, viscous spreading and photoevaporation work in resonance. When viscous accretion and photoevaporation by the central star and external massive stars are considered, the disk shrinks and is truncated at the gravitational radius, where it is quickly removed by the combination of viscous accretion, viscous spreading, photoevaporation from the central source, and photoevaporation by the external stars. There is no gap formation for disks nearby external massive stars because the outer annuli are quickly removed by the dominant EUV flux. On the other hand, at larger, more typical distances (d ≫ 0.03 pc) from the external stars the flux is FUV-dominated. As a consequence, the disk is efficiently evaporated at two different locations, forming a gap during the last stages of the disk evolution.",Physics,3,0,evolution stellar disk influence viscous evolution photoevaporation central source photoevaporation external star studied take typical parameter tauri star tt trapezium cluster condition photoionizing flux central source assumed arise quiescent star accretion shock base stellar magnetospheric column along material disk accretes accretion flux calculated selfconsistently accretion massloss rate find disk entirely removed using viscous evolution photoionization diskstar accretion shock however fuv photoevaporation external massive star included disk removed yr euv photoevaporation external massive star included disk removed yr intriguing feature photoevaporation central star formation gap disk late stage disk evolution gap start forming viscous spreading photoevaporation work resonance viscous accretion photoevaporation central star external massive star considered disk shrink truncated gravitational radius quickly removed combination viscous accretion viscous spreading photoevaporation central source photoevaporation external star gap formation disk nearby external massive star outer annulus quickly removed dominant euv flux hand larger typical distance pc external star flux fuvdominated consequence disk efficiently evaporated two different location forming gap last stage disk evolution

Longward of 1250 Å, the spectra of both planets are dominated by emission of the CO fourth positive (A1Π-X1Σ+) band system and strong O I and C I multiplets. In addition, CO Hopfield-Birge bands, B1Σ+-X1Σ+ (0, 0) at 1151 Å and C1Σ+-X1Σ+ (0, 0) at 1088 Å, are detected for the first time, and there is a weak indication of the E1Π-X1Σ+ (0, 0) band at 1076 Å in the spectrum of Venus. The B-X band is blended with emission from O I λ1152. Modeling the relative intensities of these bands suggests that resonance fluorescence of CO is the dominant source of the emission, as it is for the fourth positive system. Shortward of Lyα, other emission features detected include O II λ834, O I λ989, H I Lyβ, and N I λλ1134 and 1200.

1758,2b31555da27854622568ca7593f798cba70e6e19,A chronicle of galaxy mass assembly in the EAGLE simulation,"We analyse the mass assembly of central galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) hydrodynamical simulations. We build merger trees to connect galaxies to their progenitors at different redshifts and characterize their assembly histories by focusing on the time when half of the galaxy stellar mass was assembled into the main progenitor. We show that galaxies with stellar mass M∗ < 1010.5M_ assemble most of their stellar mass through star formation in the main progenitor (‘in situ’ star formation). This can be understood as a consequence of the steep rise in star formation efficiency with halo mass for these galaxies. For more massive galaxies, however, an increasing fraction of their stellar mass is formed outside the main progenitor and subsequently accreted. Consequently, while for low-mass galaxies, the assembly time is close to the stellar formation time, the stars in high-mass galaxies typically formed long before half of the present-day stellar mass was assembled into a single object, giving rise to the observed antihierarchical downsizing trend. In a typical present-day M∗ ≥ 1011M_ galaxy, around 20 per cent of the stellar mass has an external origin. This fraction decreases with increasing redshift. Bearing in mind that mergers only make an important contribution to the stellar mass growth of massive galaxies, we find that the dominant contribution comes from mergers with galaxies of mass greater than one-tenth of the main progenitor’s mass. The galaxy merger fraction derived from our simulations agrees with recent observational estimates.",Physics,3,0,analyse mass assembly central galaxy evolution assembly galaxy environment eagle hydrodynamical simulation build merger tree connect galaxy progenitor different redshift characterize assembly history focusing time half galaxy stellar mass assembled main progenitor show galaxy stellar mass assemble stellar mass star formation main progenitor situ star formation understood consequence steep rise star formation efficiency halo mass galaxy massive galaxy however increasing fraction stellar mass formed outside main progenitor subsequently accreted consequently lowmass galaxy assembly time close stellar formation time star highmass galaxy typically formed long half presentday stellar mass assembled single object giving rise observed antihierarchical downsizing trend typical presentday galaxy around per cent stellar mass external origin fraction decrease increasing redshift bearing mind merger make important contribution stellar mass growth massive galaxy find dominant contribution come merger galaxy mass greater onetenth main progenitor mass galaxy merger fraction derived simulation agrees recent observational estimate

The properties of four H II regions are discussed. The close correlation of the emission with specific stars indicates that photoionization by the stars themselves is the excitation mechanism, and it is proposed that this may be true for those nebulae ionized by WO stars and some rare high-excitation WN stars. The existence of these nebulae with He II emission increases the likelihood that the 4686-A emission frequently observed in dwarf emission-line galaxies is nebular in origin. This prompts the conclusion that the radiation field associated with star-forming regions can be harder than previously suspected, and reopens the issue of whether photoionization by stars in young galaxies can account for the ionization observed in QSO absorption-line systems. 42 refs.",Physics,1,0,spectroscopic observation confirming presence nebular ii emission smc h ii region n presented demonstrated ii emission associated wo star ic also extended property four h ii region discussed close correlation emission specific star indicates photoionization star excitation mechanism proposed may true nebula ionized wo star rare highexcitation wn star existence nebula ii emission increase likelihood emission frequently observed dwarf emissionline galaxy nebular origin prompt conclusion radiation field associated starforming region harder previously suspected reopens issue whether photoionization star young galaxy account ionization observed qso absorptionline system ref

A variety of observations indicate that it is nonbaryonic and nonrelativistic. One of the preferred candidates for nonbaryonic DM is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that in most models is stable. WIMP self-annihilation can produce cosmic rays, gamma rays, and other particles with signatures that may be detectable. Hints of anomalous cosmic-ray spectra found by recent experiments, such as PAMELA, have motivated interesting interpretations in terms of DM annihilation and/or decay. However, these signatures also have standard astrophysical interpretations, so additional evidence is needed in order to make a case for detection of DM annihilation or decay. Searches by the Fermi-LAT for gamma-ray signals from clumps, nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and galaxy clusters have also been performed, along with measurements of the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic gammaray emission. In addition, Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes like HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS have reported on searches for gamma-ray emission from dwarf galaxies.

It proved difficult to extend Bohr’s orbits to a polyatomic situation and the next advance had to await the development of the wave theory of matter and the associated quantum mechanics in the early 1920s.

This analysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional Hα velocity fields of NGC 4605, NGC 5949, NGC 5963, and NGC 6689 and CO velocity fields of NGC 4605 and NGC 5963. In combination with our previous study of NGC 2976, the full sample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range from αDM = 0 to αDM = 1.20, where αDM is the power-law index describing the central density profile. The scatter in αDM from galaxy to galaxy is 0.44, 3 times as large as in cold dark matter (CDM) simulations, and the mean density profile slope is αDM = 0.73, shallower than that predicted by the simulations. These results call into question the hypothesis that all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. We show that one of the galaxies in our sample, NGC 5963, has a cuspy density profile that closely resembles those seen in CDM simulations, demonstrating that while galaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by CDM do exist, they are in the minority. In spite of these differences between observations and simulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest that this problem represents a crisis for CDM. Improving the resolution of the simulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remaining discrepancies.

1788,8eaaede7b10447549bbef2cfff2f036663f2d0d7,Introducing Einstein's Relativity,"
 The aim of this book is to provide the reader with a sound mathematical introduction to Einstein’s theory of relativity, both special relativity and general relativity, as well as an understanding of the physical insights needed to explore the subject and the principles that guided Einstein in his search for the general theory of relativity. A feature of the book is that it has the numerous illustrative diagrams and exercises (of varying degrees of difficulty) which help the reader develop insight and confidence in using the mathematics. The book starts out by introducing special relativity and then the mathematics required for the rest of the book is carefully introduced. The principles underlying general relativity are introduced and it is shown how these lead to the basic field equations. These are then discussed and solved in some simple but physically important situations. The final three sections deal with the major applications of the theory and cover the topics of black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology. These sections further develop the theory but also relate the theoretical predictions to current observations. These include the recent observation of gravitational waves by LIGO, evidence for supermassive black holes at the centre of most galaxies and the detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background that provide the evidence for modern cosmology.",Physics,2,0,aim book provide reader sound mathematical introduction einstein theory relativity special relativity general relativity well understanding physical insight needed explore subject principle guided einstein search general theory relativity feature book numerous illustrative diagram exercise varying degree difficulty help reader develop insight confidence using mathematics book start introducing special relativity mathematics required rest book carefully introduced principle underlying general relativity introduced shown lead basic field equation discussed solved simple physically important situation final three section deal major application theory cover topic black hole gravitational wave cosmology section develop theory also relate theoretical prediction current observation include recent observation gravitational wave ligo evidence supermassive black hole centre galaxy detailed observation cosmic microwave background provide evidence modern cosmology

The scope of such a denunciation and the consequences relating to it were central in these debates. Starting with the analysis of the mechanism precisely set out in the Convention, this article, focusing only on the implication for non-contractual arbitration, aims at clearly establishing the meaning of consent to ICSID arbitration, one of the conditions preventing the denunciation of the Convention from having a full effect. The question thus becomes whether BITs and national laws could be considered as unilateral consent to arbitration, as understood by the drafters of the Convention. Applying concrete and correct treaty interpretation rules will enable us to establish an accurate understanding of the relevant provisions of the Convention, without depriving them of their proper meaning.",Political Science,4,0,possibility denouncing icsid convention recently sparked doctrinal controversy scope denunciation consequence relating central debate starting analysis mechanism precisely set convention article focusing implication noncontractual arbitration aim clearly establishing meaning consent icsid arbitration one condition preventing denunciation convention full effect question thus becomes whether bit national law could considered unilateral consent arbitration understood drafter convention applying concrete correct treaty interpretation rule enable u establish accurate understanding relevant provision convention without depriving proper meaning

For some purposes, we now can find it very useful indeed, at least insofar as it separates pragmatic knowledge from unverifiable belief. However, as Malinowski admitted, traditional societies often categorize knowledge is ways very different from this. Knowledge of and ethics relating to the nonhuman environment are particularly difficult to describe this way. A different way to talk about traditional environmental knowledge is as involvement in the world— more or less intense cognitive and emotional relations with nonhuman as well as human ""others."" Often, natural objects are, or contain, spirits that are part of one's society. Trying to sort out magic, science, and religion in such cases is useful, and has certainly been useful in the past (in the history of science as well as in anthropology), but perhaps more useful today is to try to understand local concepts of knowledge and interaction.

On theoretical and empirical grounds, we argue that these different realizations, which concern enactment of scripts, repetition of trials, performancebased monetary payments, and the use of deception, are bound to produce divergent experimental results. Furthermore, we argue that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings. We call for more research on the consequences of particular methodological preferences and to further this goal propose a “do-it-both-ways” rule.

1829,cbc5acecd0eb03ab85f068c22e7fd333110eece6,A Defense of Intellectual Property Rights,"Richard A. Spinello and Maria Bottis defend the thesis that intellectual property rights are justified on non-economic grounds.

Aside from revealing that bishops were often indistinguishable from lay petitioners in terms of the content of their petitions, with many of their complaints arising from their role as great landlords and tenants-in-chief rather than relating to the exercise of episcopal office, this research has also demonstrated that distinct supplicatory cultures separated the clergy from the laity. Notably, whereas petitions from lay supplicants often incorporated crown-alignment rhetoric into their petitions, thereby mirroring the language of ‘common profit’ found in common petitions, petitions from bishops reflected the supplicatory character of the clerical gravamina and presented requests for the exclusive interest of the church. As such, petitions from bishops, alongside the clerical gravamina, encapsulated a set of values, manifest through the use of language and rhetoric, which sought to assert the institutional independence of the church. Yet, despite being part of a supplicatory culture which sought to defend church autonomy and ecclesiastical jurisdictional integrity, the petitionary system in England sapped the supplicatory strength of the clergy and reduced their ability to defend their autonomy in the face of royal demands.",Political Science,4,0,thesis explores interaction bishop english crown member late medieval society generally focusing petition supplicatory strategy adopted bishop endeavour secure legal remedy aside revealing bishop often indistinguishable lay petitioner term content petition many complaint arising role great landlord tenantsinchief rather relating exercise episcopal office research also demonstrated distinct supplicatory culture separated clergy laity notably whereas petition lay supplicant often incorporated crownalignment rhetoric petition thereby mirroring language common profit found common petition petition bishop reflected supplicatory character clerical gravamina presented request exclusive interest church petition bishop alongside clerical gravamina encapsulated set value manifest use language rhetoric sought assert institutional independence church yet despite part supplicatory culture sought defend church autonomy ecclesiastical jurisdictional integrity petitionary system england sapped supplicatory strength clergy reduced ability defend autonomy face royal demand

Here we learn that while Aristotle says that theology is the most important science, Ptolemy gives that honor to mathematics (pp. 26, 29).

1889,3ece4ab9b51b22105e654e2c587d2c4fbd19f59d,A triangular theory of love.,"This article presents a triangular theory of love. According to the theory, love has three components: (a) intimacy, which encompasses the feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness one experiences in loving relationships; (b) passion, which encompasses the drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, and sexual consummation; and (c) decision/commitment, which encompasses, in the short term, the decision that one loves another, and in the long term, the commitment to maintain that love. The amount of love one experiences depends on the absolute strength of these three components, and the kind of love one experiences depends on their strengths relative to each other. The three components interact with each other and with the actions that they produce and that produce them so as to form a number of different kinds of loving experiences. The triangular theory of love subsumes certain other theories and can account for a number of empirical findings in the research literature, as well as for a number of experiences with which many are familiar firsthand. It is proposed that the triangular theory provides a rather comprehensive basis for understanding many aspects of the love that underlies close relationships. What does it mean ""to love"" someone? Does it always mean the same thing, and if not, in what ways do loves differ from each other? Why do certain loves seem to last, whereas others disappear almost as quickly as they are formed? This article seeks to answer these and other questions through a triangular theory of love. This tripartite theory deals both with the nature of love and with loves in various kinds of relationships. The presentation of the theory will be divided into three main parts. In the first part, the main tenets of the theory will be explained and discussed, and the theory will be compared with other theories of love. In the second part, the implications of the theory for close relationships and satisfaction in them will be described. In the third part, the theory will be shown to account for many of the empirical phenomena that have been observed with regard to love.",Psychology,4,0,article present triangular theory love according theory love three component intimacy encompasses feeling closeness connectedness bondedness one experience loving relationship b passion encompasses drive lead romance physical attraction sexual consummation c decisioncommitment encompasses short term decision one love another long term commitment maintain love amount love one experience depends absolute strength three component kind love one experience depends strength relative three component interact action produce produce form number different kind loving experience triangular theory love subsumes certain theory account number empirical finding research literature well number experience many familiar firsthand proposed triangular theory provides rather comprehensive basis understanding many aspect love underlies close relationship mean love someone always mean thing way love differ certain love seem last whereas others disappear almost quickly formed article seek answer question triangular theory love tripartite theory deal nature love love various kind relationship presentation theory divided three main part first part main tenet theory explained discussed theory compared theory love second part implication theory close relationship satisfaction described third part theory shown account many empirical phenomenon observed regard love

We present as an example a behaviour pattern, the grooming-hand-clasp, which occurs commonly in the chimpanzees of Kasoge but is absent in the chimpanzees of Gombe. After discussing the problems of operationally defining culture, we present eight necessary criteria of culture which are capable of empirical verification: innovation, dissemination, standardisation, durability, diffusion, tradition, non-subsistence, and natural adaptiveness. These are applied to the behaviour of wild chimpanzees andJapanese monkeys (Macacafuscata).

The “peculiar temporality” of Angst “holds” Dasein in the presence of its ownmost thrownness, yet in such a way as to hold the moment or Augenblick of possible decision “at the ready” (344). Such being held, the present study will argue, enables the distinctive phenomenon of human athos. For in disclosing Dasein in its “being toward” its ownmost possibility for Being, the temporality of Angst thereby first opens Dasein to the possibility of coming toward itself within and from out of its",Psychology,2,0,throughout marburg freiburg lecture course magnum opus time heidegger never ceased emphasize central importance phenomenon worlda phenomenon claimed never adequately appreciated understood history philosophy indeed seen hannah arendt astutely noted heidegger concept world many respect stand center philosophy time emphasized world referential totality signification enabling disclosure meaning first found possible word language sz phenomenon dasein always already exposed advance dasein could inevitably return whatever degree explicitness also highlighted fundamental attunement angst first discloses world world peculiar temporality angst hold dasein presence ownmost thrownness yet way hold moment augenblick possible decision ready held present study argue enables distinctive phenomenon human athos disclosing dasein toward ownmost possibility temporality angst thereby first open dasein possibility coming toward within

1901,e5e95b7222ac9b50308c82a6b95ac8fd9ef188ee,Phenomenology as a Form of Empathy,"Abstract This paper proposes that adopting a “phenomenological stance” enables a distinctive kind of empathy, which is required in order to understand forms of experience that occur in psychiatric illness and elsewhere. For the most part, we interpret other people's experiences against the backdrop of a shared world. Hence our attempts to appreciate interpersonal differences do not call into question a deeper level of commonality. A phenomenological stance involves suspending our habitual acceptance of that world. It thus allows us to contemplate the possibility of structurally different ways of “finding oneself in the world”. Such a stance, I suggest, can be incorporated into an empathetic appreciation of others' experiences, amounting to what we might call “radical empathy”.",Psychology,1,0,abstract paper proposes adopting phenomenological stance enables distinctive kind empathy required order understand form experience occur psychiatric illness elsewhere part interpret people experience backdrop shared world hence attempt appreciate interpersonal difference call question deeper level commonality phenomenological stance involves suspending habitual acceptance world thus allows u contemplate possibility structurally different way finding oneself world stance suggest incorporated empathetic appreciation others experience amounting might call radical empathy

While critics accuse the academy of an obsession with sexuality, they also complain that nothing that appears to refer to sex really does. In readings ranging across film, drama, opera, fine art, and critical theory, Mandy Merck considers these phenomena as well as the role of the dog in anti-porn propaganda, the unacknowledged significance of the lesbian hand, and the early retirement of the phallus. Other topics include the relationship of women's tennis and prostitution, the gendering of the wild and the tame in the age of AIDS, and the sexlessness of postmodern criticism. In Your Face ends with the face and its alleged desecration by fellatio. Germaine Greer's condemnation of Bill Clinton for ""fucking the faces of little girls"" is examined in the light of one of Monica Lewinsky's endearments for the President--""fuckface."" In a country whose last great Presidential scandal revolved around a key witness known only as ""Deep Throat"" and whose current Chief Executive works in the ""Oral Office,"" giving head is going down in history.

Certain similarities between the course of \`acute schizophrenia' and the course of manic-depressive psychoses are indicated. From consideration of the available evidence it is suggested that the schizophrenic syndrome is a non-specific clinical entity which can be symptomatic not only of organic cerebral dysfunction but also of manic-depressive psychosis—particularly the manic phase—as well as of schizophrenia itself. It is suggested in consequence that it is the form rather than the psychopathological content of the psychosis which should receive primary consideration in reaching a diagnosis, and revised definitions of schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis embodying this concept are proposed.",Psychology,2,0,traditional division functional psychosis schizophrenic manicdepressive category discussed important difference opinion signified term schizophrenia highlighted certain similarity course acute schizophrenia course manicdepressive psychosis indicated consideration available evidence suggested schizophrenic syndrome nonspecific clinical entity symptomatic organic cerebral dysfunction also manicdepressive psychosisparticularly manic phaseas well schizophrenia suggested consequence form rather psychopathological content psychosis receive primary consideration reaching diagnosis revised definition schizophrenia manicdepressive psychosis embodying concept proposed

Awareness of the breath allows us to attend to our bodies and the bodies of others, to animals, nature, other cultures, oppressed minorities, and the other of sexual difference. As a way to connect body and spirit, self and other, nature and culture, and East and West, breathing emerges as the significant theological and philosophical gesture of our time. Philosophy has too often cut off metaphysical thought from this living, breathing world with its animal and female bodies, just as religious traditions have repressed the breathing flesh in favour of calcified word. The re-introduction of breath into philosophy and theology draws our awareness back to the body, to respect for the other, and to nature, making awareness of the breath essential for an embodied ethics of difference in our globalized, ecological age. These themes are addressed by an international team of scholars, including Luce Irigaray.",Psychology,4,0,contributor volume consider implication age breath spiritual shift human awareness need figured breathing awareness breath allows u attend body body others animal nature culture oppressed minority sexual difference way connect body spirit self nature culture east west breathing emerges significant theological philosophical gesture time philosophy often cut metaphysical thought living breathing world animal female body religious tradition repressed breathing flesh favour calcified word reintroduction breath philosophy theology draw awareness back body respect nature making awareness breath essential embodied ethic difference globalized ecological age theme addressed international team scholar including luce irigaray
1927,314184a5296d365c219ba68f786f078611f7a55b,Quantitative Analysis of Purposive Systems: Some Spadework at the Foundations of Scientific Psychology,"The revolution in psychology that cybernetics at one time seemed to promise has been delayed by four blunders: (a) dismissal of control theory as a mere machine analogy, (b) failure to describe control phenomena from the behaving system's point of view, (c) applying the general control system model with its signals and functions improperly identified, and (d) focusing on man-machine systems in which the ""man"" part is conventionally described. A general nonlinear quasi-static analysis of relationships between an organism and its environment shows that the classical stimulus-response, stimulus-organism-response, or antecedent-consequent analyses of behavioral organization are special cases, a far more likely case being a control system type of relationship. Even for intermittent interactions, the control system equations lead to one simple characterization: Control systems control what they sense, opposing disturbances as they accomplish this end. A series of progressively more complex experimental demonstrations of principle illustrates both phenomena and methodology in a control system approach to the quantitative analysis of purposive systems, that is, systems in which the governing principle is control of input.",Psychology,3,0,revolution psychology cybernetics one time seemed promise delayed four blunder dismissal control theory mere machine analogy b failure describe control phenomenon behaving system point view c applying general control system model signal function improperly identified focusing manmachine system man part conventionally described general nonlinear quasistatic analysis relationship organism environment show classical stimulusresponse stimulusorganismresponse antecedentconsequent analysis behavioral organization special case far likely case control system type relationship even intermittent interaction control system equation lead one simple characterization control system control sense opposing disturbance accomplish end series progressively complex experimental demonstration principle illustrates phenomenon methodology control system approach quantitative analysis purposive system system governing principle control input

Lacan held that if the unconscious, as Freud described it, exists, it functions linguistically, rather than symbolically or instinctually. He refers to the unconscious as a language: ""the discourse of the Other."" In The Language of the Self Lacan offers a significant and fertile return to the heart of the Freudian texts. Originally published in paperback under the title Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis, this book is based on Anthony Wilden's translation of ""Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse,"" a 1953 article that became a manifesto for a generation interested in a new reading of Freud.

A Field Theorist ' s Perspective,"Progress in theoretical physics during the past decade has led to a progressively more unified understanding of the laws of nature, culminating in the recent discovery of completely unified field theories. The parallel discovery of a unified field of consciousness raises fundamental questions concerning the relationship between the two. Following a general introduction to unified quantum field theories, we consider the proposal due to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi that the unified field of modern theoretical physics and the field of ""pure consciousness"" are identical. We show that the proposed identity between consciousness and the unified field is consistent with all known physical principles, but requires an expanded physical framework for the understanding of consciousness. Such a framework may indeed be required to account for experimentally observed field effects of consciousness and phenomenological aspects of higher states of consciousness.",Psychology,4,0,progress theoretical physic past decade led progressively unified understanding law nature culminating recent discovery completely unified field theory parallel discovery unified field consciousness raise fundamental question concerning relationship two following general introduction unified quantum field theory consider proposal due maharishi mahesh yogi unified field modern theoretical physic field pure consciousness identical show proposed identity consciousness unified field consistent known physical principle requires expanded physical framework understanding consciousness framework may indeed required account experimentally observed field effect consciousness phenomenological aspect higher state consciousness

1958,82bbb440a5093498ed3e88f2e4134cc17cf2dbe8,Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation,"A theory of expectations is used to explain how music evokes various emotions for readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as music. The psychological theory of expectation that David Huron proposes in ""Sweet Anticipation"" grew out of experimental efforts to understand how music evokes emotions. These efforts evolved into a general theory of expectation that will prove informative to readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as those interested in music. The book describes a set of psychological mechanisms and illustrates how these mechanisms work in the case of music. All examples of notated music can be heard on the Web. Huron proposes that emotions evoked by expectation involve five functionally distinct response systems: reactive responses (which engage defensive reflexes); tension responses (where uncertainty leads to stress); predictive responses (which reward accurate prediction); imaginative responses (which facilitate deferred gratification); and appraisal responses (which occur after conscious thought is engaged). For real-world events, these five response systems typically produce a complex mixture of feelings. The book identifies some of the aesthetic possibilities afforded by expectation, and shows how common musical devices (such as syncopation, cadence, meter, tonality, and climax) exploit the psychological opportunities. The theory also provides new insights into the physiological psychology of awe, laughter, and ""spine-tingling chills."" Huron traces the psychology of expectations from the patterns of the physical/cultural world through imperfectly learned heuristics used to predict that world to the phenomenal qualia experienced by those who apprehend the world.",Psychology,4,0,theory expectation used explain music evokes various emotion reader interested cognitive science evolutionary psychology well music psychological theory expectation david huron proposes sweet anticipation grew experimental effort understand music evokes emotion effort evolved general theory expectation prove informative reader interested cognitive science evolutionary psychology well interested music book describes set psychological mechanism illustrates mechanism work case music example notated music heard web huron proposes emotion evoked expectation involve five functionally distinct response system reactive response engage defensive reflex tension response uncertainty lead stress predictive response reward accurate prediction imaginative response facilitate deferred gratification appraisal response occur conscious thought engaged realworld event five response system typically produce complex mixture feeling book identifies aesthetic possibility afforded expectation show common musical device syncopation cadence meter tonality climax exploit psychological opportunity theory also provides new insight physiological psychology awe laughter spinetingling chill huron trace psychology expectation pattern physicalcultural world imperfectly learned heuristic used predict world phenomenal qualia experienced apprehend world

1976,dee33567d7ea923ec056809799bc0774ef0f684d,An Introduction to Radical Constructivism,"The experiencing consciousness creates structure in the flow of its experience, and that structure is what conscious cognitive organisms experience as “reality.” Since that reality is created almost entirely without the experiencer’s awareness of his or her creative activity, it comes to appear as given by an independently “existing” world. Once knowing is no longer understood as the search for an iconic representation of ontological reality but, instead, as a search for fitting ways of behaving and thinking, the traditional problem of epistemology disappears. Knowledge can now be seen as something which the organism builds up in the attempt to order the as such amorphous flow of experience by establishing repeatable experiences and relatively reliable relations between them. The possibilities of constructing such an order are determined and perpetually constrained by the preceding steps in the construction. That means that the “real” world manifests itself exclusively where our constructions break down. Moreover, we can describe and explain these breakdowns only in the very concepts that we have used to build the failing structures.",Psychology,4,0,experiencing consciousness creates structure flow experience structure conscious cognitive organism experience reality since reality created almost entirely without experiencers awareness creative activity come appear given independently existing world knowing longer understood search iconic representation ontological reality instead search fitting way behaving thinking traditional problem epistemology disappears knowledge seen something organism build attempt order amorphous flow experience establishing repeatable experience relatively reliable relation possibility constructing order determined perpetually constrained preceding step construction mean real world manifest exclusively construction break moreover describe explain breakdown concept used build failing structure

In this context it makes sense to consider that the notion of scientific reduction is linked to a classic scientific conception of nature.

Four main kinds of ritual were found to predominate: cleaning, avoiding, repeating and checking. A surprisingly large number of patients had little or no resistance to carrying out their rituals. The recognition of senselessness of a ritual was a more important criterion than that of resistance, but patients with predominantly repeating rituals did demonstrate resistance. It is proposed that a redefinition of obsessive-compulsive neurosis with less emphasis on resistance as a necessary condition may be appropriate.",Psychology,3,0,summary fortyfive patient obsessivecompulsive neurosis given specially devised structured interview aim elucidating aspect phenomenology four main kind ritual found predominate cleaning avoiding repeating checking surprisingly large number patient little resistance carrying ritual recognition senselessness ritual important criterion resistance patient predominantly repeating ritual demonstrate resistance proposed redefinition obsessivecompulsive neurosis le emphasis resistance necessary condition may appropriate
2000,3565e6c9aaeb4cf27390705b624679beca8dec56,The replication crisis: How might philosophy and theory of psychology be of use?,"Psychology is experiencing what many deem a “crisis,” often called a “replication crisis.” In response and with impressive speed, technical changes are being introduced to remedy perceived problems in data analysis, researcher bias, and publication practices. Yet throughout these large-scale renovations of scientific practice, scarce attention is given to philosophical and theoretical commitments as potential factors in the crisis problems. Analysis of involved psychologists’ understandings of scientific crisis, replication, and epistemology indicates the need for philosophical examinations. Likewise warranting close analyses are the associated assumptions about objectivity, credibility, and ontology (the nature of psychological phenomena). Such lacuna in the crisis interrogations constitute opportunities for researchers with expertise in the philosophy and theory of psychology to contribute to the science’s immediate problems and collaborate more closely with experimental psychologists.",Psychology,4,0,psychology experiencing many deem crisis often called replication crisis response impressive speed technical change introduced remedy perceived problem data analysis researcher bias publication practice yet throughout largescale renovation scientific practice scarce attention given philosophical theoretical commitment potential factor crisis problem analysis involved psychologist understanding scientific crisis replication epistemology indicates need philosophical examination likewise warranting close analysis associated assumption objectivity credibility ontology nature psychological phenomenon lacuna crisis interrogation constitute opportunity researcher expertise philosophy theory psychology contribute science immediate problem collaborate closely experimental psychologist

Inspired by Grice’s seminal proposal, this area typically aims to uncover how sentence meaning is integrated while the listener is determining the speaker’s intended meaning. This chapter summarizes the findings with respect to three prominent experimental pragmatic topics: scalar implicature (e.g. the way some can implicitly mean some but not all); reference (e.g. how a listener goes about establishing which object among several is being referred to); and irony (which involves defining it and determining the extent to which cognitive effort and mindreading is critical to processing it).

In so doing, he develops an overview of the mental representations invoked by the language, visual, and musical faculties, and describes how they are used in perception, production, imagery, and thought. He then explores how these representations determine the character of conscious awareness, arriving at the ""Intermediate Level Theory"" of consciousness, an account strikingly different from and more empirically adequate than the many previous theories examined in the book.",Psychology,4,0,consciousness computational mind ray jackendoff probe one fundamental issue cognitive psychology conscious experience come way develops overview mental representation invoked language visual musical faculty describes used perception production imagery thought explores representation determine character conscious awareness arriving intermediate level theory consciousness account strikingly different empirically adequate many previous theory examined book

It is, in fact, quite comprehensive.

The meeting led to a collaboration, and eventually to marriage. The medical literature seems to be dry and scientific enough that this personal note was quite welcome. After reading the book, it was apparent that compliance, although important, was not the main theme addressed by the authors, but that their book was a rather comprehensive and insightful overview of many critical issues in doctor-patient communication. Selected aspects of the doctor-patient relationship (such as interviewing, cultural perspective, and the different health belief models) are, of course, covered in other texts.

I explore these issues phenomenologically by examining five kinds of experiences that counter hope (or in some instances, seem to do so): first, by noting the cases in which hope simply is not operative, then by treating the significance of both desperation and pessimism, next by examining the experience of hopelessness, and finally, by treating the experience of despair. Here despair is shown to constitute the most profound challenge to hope among these experiences and to be foundational for the others, even though it is disclosed ultimately as founded in hope.",Psychology,1,0,abstract paper investigate experience hope focusing experience seem rival hope namely disappointment desperation panic hopelessness despair explore issue phenomenologically examining five kind experience counter hope instance seem first noting case hope simply operative treating significance desperation pessimism next examining experience hopelessness finally treating experience despair despair shown constitute profound challenge hope among experience foundational others even though disclosed ultimately founded hope

2032,bced25c0822a5c755cae7dabd081aa19148b94be,Mind: A Brief Introduction,"""The philosophy of mind is unique among contemporary philosophical subjects,"" writes John Searle, ""in that all of the most famous and influential theories are false."" In ""Mind"", Searle dismantles these famous and influential theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. Here readers will find one of the world's most eminent thinkers shedding light on the central concern of modern philosophy. Searle begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind-which he calls ""Descartes and Other Disasters""-problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as the freedom of the will, the actual operation of mental causation, the nature and functioning of the unconscious, the analysis of perception, and the concept of the self. One of the key chapters is on the mind-body problem, which Searle analyzes brilliantly. He argues that all forms of consciousness-from feeling thirsty to wondering how to translate Mallarme-are caused by the behavior of neurons and are realized in the brain system, which is itself composed of neurons. But this does not mean that consciousness is nothing but neuronal behavior. The main point of having the concept of consciousness, Searle points out, is to capture the first person subjective features of the phenomenon and this point is lost if we redefine consciousness in third person objective terms. Described as a ""dragonslayer by temperament,"" John Searle offers here a refreshingly direct and open discussion of philosophy, one that skewers accepted wisdom even as it offers striking new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind.",Psychology,4,0,philosophy mind unique among contemporary philosophical subject writes john searle famous influential theory false mind searle dismantles famous influential theory present vividly written comprehensive introduction mind reader find one world eminent thinker shedding light central concern modern philosophy searle begin look twelve problem philosophy mindwhich call descartes disastersproblems return throughout volume illuminates topic freedom actual operation mental causation nature functioning unconscious analysis perception concept self one key chapter mindbody problem searle analyzes brilliantly argues form consciousnessfrom feeling thirsty wondering translate mallarmeare caused behavior neuron realized brain system composed neuron mean consciousness nothing neuronal behavior main point concept consciousness searle point capture first person subjective feature phenomenon point lost redefine consciousness third person objective term described dragonslayer temperament john searle offer refreshingly direct open discussion philosophy one skewer accepted wisdom even offer striking new insight nature consciousness mind

This paper reviews the history of the loudness war and explores some of its possible consequences, including aesthetic concerns and listening fatigue. Next, the loudness war is analyzed in terms of game theory. Evidence is presented to question the assumption that loudness is significantly correlated to listener preference and sales rankings.

However, the psychopaths were performing significantly better than Happe's most highly able adult autistic population.

In particular, the roles played by the envious party's social comparison with, and ill will against, the better off are emphasised. The ill will component is characterised by the envier's ultimate goal or wish that the envied suffer some harm, and is distinguished from resentment and sense of injustice, which have often been considered part of envy. The reprehensible nature of envy is discussed, and traced back to the analysis of its components. Finally, we explore both points of overlap and distinguishing features between envy and other emotions such as jealousy or emulation, and make a few general remarks, pointing to the necessity of overcoming conceptual looseness in the notion of envy.",Psychology,3,0,work provides analysis basic cognitive component envy particular role played envious party social comparison ill better emphasised ill component characterised enviers ultimate goal wish envied suffer harm distinguished resentment sense injustice often considered part envy reprehensible nature envy discussed traced back analysis component finally explore point overlap distinguishing feature envy emotion jealousy emulation make general remark pointing necessity overcoming conceptual looseness notion envy

Different groups of sources are explored: philological and antiquarian writings, pedagogical treatises, debates on the respective merits of the liberal and mechanical arts, essays on cryptography and the art of gestures, polemical pamphlets on university reform, universal language scheme, and philosophical analyses of the conduct of the understanding. In the late 17th-century the philosophy of mind discards both the correspondence of predicamental series to reality and the archetypal metaphysics underpinning it. This is a turning point in semantic theory: language is conceived as the social construction of historical-conventional objects through signs and the study of strategies we use to bridge the gap between the privacy of experience and the publicness of speech emerges as one of the main topics in the philosophy of language.",Psychology,4,0,focus volume crisis traditional view relationship word thing emergence linguistic arbitrarism thcentury british philosophy different group source explored philological antiquarian writing pedagogical treatise debate respective merit liberal mechanical art essay cryptography art gesture polemical pamphlet university reform universal language scheme philosophical analysis conduct understanding late thcentury philosophy mind discard correspondence predicamental series reality archetypal metaphysics underpinning turning point semantic theory language conceived social construction historicalconventional object sign study strategy use bridge gap privacy experience publicness speech emerges one main topic philosophy language

Instead, alternative critical strategies are suggested based upon understanding cognitive science as a knowledge-producing practice, investigating how it constructs its object of interest (individuals regarded as akin to computational devices) and revealing the practical means by which it comes to represent that object theoretically. Drawing on recent work in the sociology of science and critical anthropology, it is argued that many of the practices of cognitive science can be addressed in terms of how time is constructed and manipulated. This perspective leads to discussions of a variety of issues, including the nature of experimental practice, the status of the concept of representation in cognitive theory, the relationship between knowledge and power, and the prospects for alternative `reflexive' knowledge forms.",Psychology,4,0,paper build observation sociological phenomenological philosophical critique cognitivism little impact research agenda cognitive science instead alternative critical strategy suggested based upon understanding cognitive science knowledgeproducing practice investigating construct object interest individual regarded akin computational device revealing practical mean come represent object theoretically drawing recent work sociology science critical anthropology argued many practice cognitive science addressed term time constructed manipulated perspective lead discussion variety issue including nature experimental practice status concept representation cognitive theory relationship knowledge power prospect alternative reflexive knowledge form

Imprecision and vagueness hamper comparisons between series. In childhood psychoses some investigators have excluded those cases in which there was any history or clinical evidence of organic features in an attempt to obtain a ‘pure’ group.

This is a mistake. We should instead understand their phenomenology in terms of their distinctively evaluative intentionality. Emotions are essentially affective modes of response to the ways our circumstances come to matter to us, and so they are ways of being pleased or pained by those circumstances. Making sense of the intentionality and phenomenology of emotions in this way requires rejecting traditional understandings of intentionality and coming to see emotions as a distinctive and irreducible class of mental states lying at the intersection of intentionality, phenomenology, and motivation.",Psychology,2,0,phenomenology emotion traditionally understood term bodily sensation involve mistake instead understand phenomenology term distinctively evaluative intentionality emotion essentially affective mode response way circumstance come matter u way pleased pained circumstance making sense intentionality phenomenology emotion way requires rejecting traditional understanding intentionality coming see emotion distinctive irreducible class mental state lying intersection intentionality phenomenology motivation

2064,ef2fe48433e9225f7b403a35564c2de579c60304,Moral Phenomenology and Moral Theory,"Appeals to moral phenomenology—the phenomenology of moral experience—are common in moral philosophy, particularly in metaethical inquiry. But as far as we can tell, the topic of moral phenomenology has not typically been center stage—a focus of inquiry in ethics. And so, going back at least to the writings of G. E. Moore (and with some notable exceptions— see below), very little has been written about the nature and significance of moral phenomenology. This is not only the case in connection with metaethical inquiry; the same lack of inquiry is to be found among those whose main interests in ethics are in normative moral theory. As we just mentioned, there are some exceptions—and the exceptions will help us zero in on our target in what we say below. So let us mention two thinkers whose works we will use as a starting point for thinking about moral phenomenology. First, in 1938, philosopher and gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Ko¨hler published The Place of Value in a World of Facts, whose aim was to make sense of the ubiquitous notion of 'requiredness' that is common to logic, scientific inquiry, and what we may just call 'practical inquiry'. All of these fields involve requiredness or what we now call normativity, and Ko¨hler thought that the evolving naturalistic picture of the world that is presented to us by science does not clearly leave a place for normativity. His task was to find a place for it. And his method for doing so was to focus first on providing a phenomenological description of experiences of requiredness. Maurice Mandelbaum's 1955 book, The Phenomenology of Moral Experience, is less grand in scope than is Ko¨hler's—as his title indicates, Mandelbaum is concerned with our moral experiences. But the specific focus of his book is on the phenomenology of moral requiredness and, like Ko¨hler, he makes a case for the methodo-logical priority of phenomenological description in carrying out a certain philosophical project in ethics. While Ko¨hler is concerned with the",Psychology,4,0,appeal moral phenomenologythe phenomenology moral experienceare common moral philosophy particularly metaethical inquiry far tell topic moral phenomenology typically center stagea focus inquiry ethic going back least writing g e moore notable exception see little written nature significance moral phenomenology case connection metaethical inquiry lack inquiry found among whose main interest ethic normative moral theory mentioned exceptionsand exception help u zero target say let u mention two thinker whose work use starting point thinking moral phenomenology first philosopher gestalt psychologist wolfgang kohler published place value world fact whose aim make sense ubiquitous notion requiredness common logic scientific inquiry may call practical inquiry field involve requiredness call normativity kohler thought evolving naturalistic picture world presented u science clearly leave place normativity task find place method focus first providing phenomenological description experience requiredness maurice mandelbaums book phenomenology moral experience le grand scope kohlersas title indicates mandelbaum concerned moral experience specific focus book phenomenology moral requiredness like kohler make case methodological priority phenomenological description carrying certain philosophical project ethic kohler concerned

However, psychological interpretation is still not underscored in Christian tradition. In this paper, first, hermeneutical exegeses on the biblical dreams and especially Pharaoh's chief cupbearer's (or butler's) and chief bakers' dream narratives (Gen. 40: 5-13, 16-18) are investigated. Second, the general meanings of dreams are defined and explained from some ancient Hellenistic philosophers', i.e.  Aristotle, Cicero, Eusebius, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Philo of Alexandria, and Plato, understandings. Furthermore, special attention is given to Philo of Alexandria's hermeneutics on the two dream narratives. Third, it is the thesis of this paper that the two dream narratives are exceptions and can be also interpreted in the light of modern dream interpretation, especially Freudian, Jungian, and other psychoanalysis, as well as a cognitive judgment approach called the equate-to-differentiate model. Seeing them through the lens of psychology and for the first time through the baker's cognitive perspective can aid us in our understanding of human nature while enhancing the study of both traditional theology and psychology.",Psychology,4,0,intriguing study dream bible cut across traditional field biblical textual criticism comparative religion philosophy genre writing analysis also psychoanalyses however psychological interpretation still underscored christian tradition paper first hermeneutical exegesis biblical dream especially pharaoh chief cupbearer butler chief baker dream narrative gen investigated second general meaning dream defined explained ancient hellenistic philosopher ie aristotle cicero eusebius heraclitus herodotus philo alexandria plato understanding furthermore special attention given philo alexandria hermeneutics two dream narrative third thesis paper two dream narrative exception also interpreted light modern dream interpretation especially freudian jungian psychoanalysis well cognitive judgment approach called equatetodifferentiate model seeing lens psychology first time baker cognitive perspective aid u understanding human nature enhancing study traditional theology psychology

I am puzzled by what motive could underlie the unusual ferocity which an irregardless or a hopefully or a singular media can elicit. In his second edition of On Writing Well (New York, 1980), for example, William Zinsser, an otherwise amiable man I'm sure, uses, and quotes not disapprovingly, words like detestable vulgarity (p. 43), garbage (p. 44), atrocity (p. 46), horrible (p. 48); oaf (p. 42), idiot (p. 43), and simple illiteracy (p. 46), to comment on usages like OK, hopefully, the affix -wise, and myself in He invited Mary and myself to dinner. The last thing I want to seem is sanctimonious. But as I am sure Zinsser would agree, what happens in Cambodia and Afghanistan could more reasonably be called horrible atrocities. The likes of Idi Amin qualify as legitimate oafs. Idiots we have more than enough of in our state institutions. And while simply illiteracy is the condition of billions, it does not characterize those who use disinterested in its original sense.1 I am puzzled why some errors should excite this seeming fury while others, not obviously different in kind, seem to excite only moderate disapproval.

They are defined exclusively by their occurrence close to delivery. Attempts to further diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychoses have been prevented to date by the influence of Kraepelin’s dichotomy. New possibilities of nosological differentiation arose out of Kasanin’s (1933) description of schizoaffective psychoses and out of Leonhard’s differentiated nosology (1986). The objective of the present, retrospective study was to apply Leonhard’s nosology to 42 postpartal psychoses. Five diagnostic groups could be identified: 6 cases of manic-depressive disorder, 7 cases of pure depression, 8 cases of pure melancholia, 2 cases of unsystematic schizophrenia, and 19 cases of cycloid psychoses. For this reason we consider that the concept of the cycloid psychoses is appropriate for the characterization of a large proportion of childbed psychoses.",Psychology,3,0,puerperal psychosis traditionally considered nosologically unspecific defined exclusively occurrence close delivery attempt diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychosis prevented date influence kraepelins dichotomy new possibility nosological differentiation arose kasanins description schizoaffective psychosis leonhards differentiated nosology objective present retrospective study apply leonhards nosology postpartal psychosis five diagnostic group could identified case manicdepressive disorder case pure depression case pure melancholia case unsystematic schizophrenia case cycloid psychosis reason consider concept cycloid psychosis appropriate characterization large proportion childbed psychosis

The main focus of the chapter is on the alleged contribution that concepts make to the phenomenology of visual experience.

Religion and psychology have often been in competition over their shared interest in providing an understanding of what it means to be human. As a matter of presupposition, both psychology and religion require some prior philosophical anthropology, and it is at this most basic level that the tensions between the two arise. In the West, the clash between religion and psychology reflects the contradictory Western conceptual traditions of Judeo-Christian subjective engagement versus Greek objective detachment.

Specifically, the Incongruity Hypothesis posits that humor is our confrontation with a stimulus that is surprising or inconsistent with the way we normally view the world. The Hermetic Hypothesis maintains that the incongruity of humorous statements or events exploits shared cultural (i.e., schematic) knowledge. The Deprecation Hypothesis suggests that humor involves lowering the status of a target individual, group, or object. This paper tests a number of predictions derived from these approaches using statements that isolate the types of violations in both form (i.e., schematic or ontological template violations) and content (i.e., deprecating or non-deprecating).

In this article, we examine some aspects of the rhetoric of justification, which in part draws on statistical data analysis to shore up facts and inductive inferences.

2091,3d964a81bea8365744570666404ddbacaed25012,"The Chinese Heart in a Cognitive Perspective: Culture, Body, and Language","This book is a cognitive semantic study of the Chinese conceptualization of the heart, traditionally seen as the central faculty of cognition. The Chinese word xin, which primarily denotes the heart organ, covers the meanings of both ""heart"" and ""mind"" as understood in English, which upholds a heart-head dichotomy. In contrast to the Western dualist view, Chinese takes on a more holistic view that sees the heart as the center of both emotions and thought. The contrast characterizes two cultural traditions that have developed different conceptualizations of person, self, and agent of cognition. The concept of ""heart"" lies at the core of Chinese thought and medicine, and its importance to Chinese culture is extensively manifested in the Chinese language. Diachronically, this book traces the roots of its conception in ancient Chinese philosophy and traditional Chinese medicine. Along the synchronic dimension, it not only makes a systematic analysis of conventionalized expressions that reflect the underlying cultural models and conceptualizations, as well as underlying conceptual metaphors and metonymies, but also attempts a textual analysis of an essay and a number of poems for their metaphoric and metonymic images and imports contributing to the cultural models and conceptualizations. It also takes up a comparative perspective that sheds light on similarities and differences between Western and Chinese cultures in the understanding of the heart, brain, body, mind, self, and person. The book contributes to the understanding of the embodied nature of human cognition situated in its cultural context, and the relationship between language, culture, and cognition.",Psychology,4,0,book cognitive semantic study chinese conceptualization heart traditionally seen central faculty cognition chinese word xin primarily denotes heart organ cover meaning heart mind understood english upholds hearthead dichotomy contrast western dualist view chinese take holistic view see heart center emotion thought contrast characterizes two cultural tradition developed different conceptualization person self agent cognition concept heart lie core chinese thought medicine importance chinese culture extensively manifested chinese language diachronically book trace root conception ancient chinese philosophy traditional chinese medicine along synchronic dimension make systematic analysis conventionalized expression reflect underlying cultural model conceptualization well underlying conceptual metaphor metonymy also attempt textual analysis essay number poem metaphoric metonymic image import contributing cultural model conceptualization also take comparative perspective shed light similarity difference western chinese culture understanding heart brain body mind self person book contributes understanding embodied nature human cognition situated cultural context relationship language culture cognition

Gregory in his contribution to the debate initiated by the Journal of Literary Theory concerning the long-term relations between literature and ethics (Gregory 2010, 282). Gregory argues that ethical criticism has received a »second chance« after being »killed, crushed, annihilated« throughout the 20th century (ibid., 274). To avoid squandering this opportunity, he suggests, it is crucial to identify »what’s at stake in ethical criticism« (ibid., 282). In this article, we join Gregory and subsequent contributors in the effort to rethink the role of ethical criticism in the context of contemporary literary scholarship (Rabinowitz 2010; Groeben 2011; Titzmann 2012). We wish to turn attention to an issue that has thus far been largely ignored in this debate: the role of postmodern criticism in shaping the new face of ethical criticism. In particular, we challenge the concept of empathy and the assumption that empathy is a fundamental element of ethical reading.",Psychology,4,0,ethical criticism back declares marshall w gregory contribution debate initiated journal literary theory concerning longterm relation literature ethic gregory gregory argues ethical criticism received second chance killed crushed annihilated throughout th century ibid avoid squandering opportunity suggests crucial identify whats stake ethical criticism ibid article join gregory subsequent contributor effort rethink role ethical criticism context contemporary literary scholarship rabinowitz groeben titzmann wish turn attention issue thus far largely ignored debate role postmodern criticism shaping new face ethical criticism particular challenge concept empathy assumption empathy fundamental element ethical reading

As the English as a lingua franca field of enquiry grows, this article provides needed dialogue, consideration, and reflection over how we conceptualise our subject matter, our roles, and our rhetorical stances. This paper proposes the usefulness of considering the complexity of language, not as something that gets in the way of empiricism or clarity, but as something that makes ELF researchers perfectly positioned to investigate and contribute to wider understandings of language. Complexity theory is drawn upon as a conceptual tool that can be useful in guiding our thinking about the dynamic nature of language, which, in turn, is considered in relation to the reasons why language is complex, namely its roles in relation to practices and contextualisation. Having established our approaches to the complexity of the language in ELF scenarios, we propose implications for ELF researchers' treatment of speakers, language, and ideology.",Psychology,3,0,abstract paper set theoretical approach language guide author research field underrepresented literature english lingua franca field enquiry grows article provides needed dialogue consideration reflection conceptualise subject matter role rhetorical stance paper proposes usefulness considering complexity language something get way empiricism clarity something make elf researcher perfectly positioned investigate contribute wider understanding language complexity theory drawn upon conceptual tool useful guiding thinking dynamic nature language turn considered relation reason language complex namely role relation practice contextualisation established approach complexity language elf scenario propose implication elf researcher treatment speaker language ideology
2137,c53b9df3eedefdd6cba589214d7030c339df6270,Metapragmatic discourse and metapragmatic function,"The aim here is to clarify the nature of what have come to be called in the literature, following Silverstein (1976: 48–51), METAPRAGMATIC phenomena. In particular, the aim is to clarify the distinction between metapragmatic FUNCTIONS of two semiotic types and between such metapragmatic functions and metapragmatic DISCOURSE. Signs functioning metapragmatically have pragmatic phenomena — indexical sign phenomena — as their semiotic objects; they thus have an inherently “framing,” or “regimenting,” or “stipulative” character with respect to indexical phenomena. In this way, as illustrated in the accompanying chapters, the metapragmatic—pragmatic nexus lies at the intersection of specific theoretical concerns with one or another facet of the total linguistic fact. Let me point out some of these concerns. First, there is the line of focus on the language—metalanguage relationship, coming out of the logico-linguistic tradition of analytic philosophy and formal syntax. Here, we assume that there is some language in the usual sense, i.e., some grammatically conforming system of expression-types, tokens of which refer-to some universe of referents and predicate-about some universe of states-of-affairs, and that the objects of reference-and-predication happen to be themselves grammatically conforming expressions of some language, called, by virtue of this, the OBJECT LANGUAGE of metalinguistic usage.

2141,9833b9d07cc8f8b302008fbbb9ebfb2fa68f8db4,The Game of Humor: A Comprehensive Theory of Why We Laugh,"Humor, wit, and laughter surround each person. From everyday quips to the carefully contrived comedy of literature, newspapers, and television we experience humor in many forms, yet the impetus for our laughter is far from innocuous. Misfortune, stupidity, and moral or cultural defects, however faintly revealed in others and ourselves, seem to make us laugh. Although discomforting, such negative terms as superiority, aggression, hostility, ridicule, or degradation can be applied to instances of humor. According to scholars, Thomas Hobbes's ""superiority theory""--that humor arises from mischances, infirmities, and indecencies, where there is no wit at all--applies to most humor. With the exception of good-natured play, Charles R. Gruner claims that humor is rarely as innocent as it first appears. Gruner's proposed superiority theory of humor is all-encompassing. In The Game of Humor, he expands the scope of Hobbes's theory to include and explore the contest aspect of ""good-natured"" play. As such, the author believes all instances of humor can be examined as games, in terms of competition and keeping score--winners and losers. Gruner draws on a broad spectrum of thought-provoking examples. Holocaust jokes, sexual humor, the racialist dialogue of such comic characters as Stepin Fetchit and Archie Bunker, simple puns, and many of the author's own encounters with everyday humor. Gruner challenges the reader to offer a single example of humor that cannot be ""de-humorized"" by its agonistic nature. The Game of Humor makes intriguing and enjoyable reading for people interested in humor and the aspects of human motivation. This book will also be valuable to professionals in communication and information studies, sociologists, literary critics and linguists, and psychologists concerned with the conflicts and tensions of everyday life.",Psychology,4,0,humor wit laughter surround person everyday quip carefully contrived comedy literature newspaper television experience humor many form yet impetus laughter far innocuous misfortune stupidity moral cultural defect however faintly revealed others seem make u laugh although discomforting negative term superiority aggression hostility ridicule degradation applied instance humor according scholar thomas hobbes superiority theorythat humor arises mischance infirmity indecency wit allapplies humor exception goodnatured play charles r gruner claim humor rarely innocent first appears gruners proposed superiority theory humor allencompassing game humor expands scope hobbes theory include explore contest aspect goodnatured play author belief instance humor examined game term competition keeping scorewinners loser gruner draw broad spectrum thoughtprovoking example holocaust joke sexual humor racialist dialogue comic character stepin fetchit archie bunker simple pun many author encounter everyday humor gruner challenge reader offer single example humor dehumorized agonistic nature game humor make intriguing enjoyable reading people interested humor aspect human motivation book also valuable professional communication information study sociologist literary critic linguist psychologist concerned conflict tension everyday life

Based on theory and research on both psychology of humor and psychology of religion, as well as on the psychological anthropology of early Christianity, the present paper inspects the ways in which religion is related to personality traits, cognitive structures and social consequences associated with sense of humor.

Resisting the conventional wisdom that says that if the mind is a large neural network it cannot simultaneously be a manipulator of symbols, Marcus outlines a variety of ways in which neural systems could be organized so as to manipulate symbols, and he shows why such systems are more likely to provide an adequate substrate for language and cognition than neural systems that are inconsistent with the manipulation of symbols. Concluding with a discussion of how a neurally realized system of symbol-manipulation could have evolved and how such a system could unfold developmentally within the womb, Marcus helps to set the future agenda of cognitive neuroscience.",Psychology,3,0,algebraic mind gary marcus attempt integrate two theory mind work one say mind computerlike manipulator symbol another say mind large network neuron working together parallel resisting conventional wisdom say mind large neural network simultaneously manipulator symbol marcus outline variety way neural system could organized manipulate symbol show system likely provide adequate substrate language cognition neural system inconsistent manipulation symbol concluding discussion neurally realized system symbolmanipulation could evolved system could unfold developmentally within womb marcus help set future agenda cognitive neuroscience

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by ""success"" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. ""Statistical significance"" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental ""cuteness"" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.",Psychology,3,0,physical theory typically predict numerical value improvement experimental precision reduces tolerance range hence increase corroborability psychological research improved power statistical design lead prior probability approaching finding significant difference theoretically predicted direction hence corroboration yielded success weak becomes weaker increased precision statistical significance play logical role psychology precisely reverse role physic problem worsened certain unhealthy tendency prevalent among psychologist premium placed experimental cuteness free reliance upon ad hoc explanation avoid refutation

2157,b94b96d38013cda50a704d6b679f9442eac30233,A reappraisal of Wilhelm Wundt.,"Approximately 100 years ago, in an era of intellectual ferment, events of marked consequence took place in the history of psychology. It was in the decade of the 1870s that the first handbook of experimental psychology appeared, followed soon by the founding of the first formal laboratory of experimental psychology. Both were the achievements of Wilhelm Wundt, ever since recognized as experimental psychology's great patron, though later barred from any role that might remotely resemble sainthood. Soon after the wave of ""new"" psychologists spread out from Wundt's laboratory, a series of intellectual revolutions largely erased from memory the content of Wundtian psychological theory. Now that the movement set in motion by Wundt has come through its first century, it would seem fitting to mark the centenary by briefly turning back, reexamining psychology's historical foundations, and paying homage to the founding father. There is, however, another reason for review, being less ceremonial and clearly more interesting. To put it simply, the few current Wundt-scholars (and some do exist) are in fair agreement that Wundt as portrayed today in many texts and courses is largely fictional and often bears little resemblance to the actual historical figure (cf. Blumenthal, 1970; Bringmann, Balance, & Evans, 1975; Mischel, 1970). Naturally, it might be suspected that the above radical statement is only the nit-picking of a few antiquarians obsessed with minor matters of interpretation. But alas, such is not the case. These are claims about the very fundamentals of Wundt's work, often asserting the opposite of what has been a standard description prevailing over much of the past century.

It shows how good theorizing explains or tries to explain such abilities as perception and cognition. It recasts the familiar explanations of ""intelligence"" and ""cognitive capacity"" as put forward by philosophers such as Fodor, Dennett, and others in terms of a theory of explanation that makes established doctrine more intelligible to professionals and their students.In particular, the book shows that vestigial adherence to the positivists' D-N model has distorted the view of philosophers of science about what psychologists (and biologists) do and has masked the real nature of explanation.

It is not cross-cultural psychology. It is not psychological anthropology. It is not ethnopsychology. It is cultural psychology. And its time may have arrived, once again. While the authors in this volume were never asked to define or explicitly address the idea of a cultural psychology, several of the chapters turned out to be examples of it. They inspired this essay – which is a preliminary attempt to say, taxonomically and narratively, and briefly – what the discipline of cultural psychology was, is, and ought to be about. Ultimately it is a story of cyclical return. In the short run, however, the essay is a story of one of the pitfalls of the “cognitive revolution” of the 1960s, the failure of the cognitive revolution to develop an adequate theory of the “person,” because of the prevailing Platonism implicit in its scientific agenda. The essay is also a scouting expedition across the boundaries of some very treacherous disciplinary territories in the search to recover an important interdisciplinary identity. Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, transform, and permute the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion. Cultural psychology is the study of the ways subject and object, self and other, psyche and culture, person and context, figure and ground, practitioner and practice live together, require each other, and dynamically, dialectically, and jointly make each other up.",Psychology,4,0,discipline emerging called cultural psychology general psychology crosscultural psychology psychological anthropology ethnopsychology cultural psychology time may arrived author volume never asked define explicitly address idea cultural psychology several chapter turned example inspired essay preliminary attempt say taxonomically narratively briefly discipline cultural psychology ought ultimately story cyclical return short run however essay story one pitfall cognitive revolution failure cognitive revolution develop adequate theory person prevailing platonism implicit scientific agenda essay also scouting expedition across boundary treacherous disciplinary territory search recover important interdisciplinary identity cultural psychology study way cultural tradition social practice regulate express transform permute human psyche resulting le psychic unity humankind ethnic divergence mind self emotion cultural psychology study way subject object self psyche culture person context figure ground practitioner practice live together require dynamically dialectically jointly make

With impressive erudition Waldenfels weaves in xenological themes from classical philosophy, contemporary phenomenology, literature, linguistics, sociology, and anthropology to address the boundaries of experience that unite and separate human beings, their collectives, their perceptions, and aspirations. While the debate has long raged in German-speaking circles, Waldenfels s work is largely unavailable to the English-speaking audience, with the only other translation being ""The Order in the Twilight"" (1996).
