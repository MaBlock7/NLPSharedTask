Lara Thompson looks at the way light informs the cinematic experience, from constructing star identities, sculpting natural light and creating imaginary worlds, to the seductive power of darkness, fading representations of the past and arresting twilight encounters. 
 
This groundbreaking and accessible introductory study investigates the way illumination has transcended its diffuse functional boundaries and been elevated to a position of narrative and emotional importance, transforming it from an unobtrusive element of film style to an expressive and essential component. It includes analyses of over fifty renowned international films, discussed in inventive and illuminating combinations, from cinema's earliest moments to its most recent digital manifestations.",Art,5,0,unique wideranging analysis aesthetic emotional impact lighting cinema lara thompson look way light informs cinematic experience constructing star identity sculpting natural light creating imaginary world seductive power darkness fading representation past arresting twilight encounter groundbreaking accessible introductory study investigates way illumination transcended diffuse functional boundary elevated position narrative emotional importance transforming unobtrusive element film style expressive essential component includes analysis fifty renowned international film discussed inventive illuminating combination cinema earliest moment recent digital manifestation

Two wildly popular rowing regattas he staged in 1873 and 1874, Nicholson argues, were critical moments in the development of intercollegiate athletics. Despite his accomplishments, Morrissey’s unseemly life and his untimely death in 1878 led revisionists and reformers to erase his important role in early American sport. Nicholson’s biography is a lively account of a unique nineteenth-century Irish-American life. It will be of interest to a wide range of readers interested in topics such as the culture of antebellum New York, the history of Saratoga, and the revival of American horse racing after the Civil War. Nicholson’s claims for Morrissey’s importance are difficult to evaluate, however, because he does not engage with the wider body of scholarship on the nineteenth-century transformation of sport. In particular, the argument that the Saratoga regattas marked “the birth of intercollegiate sports on the modern scale” (in the words of journalist Edward Hotaling, quoted approvingly by Nicholson) cannot be sustained without reference to this literature (124).

Federico Zignani's expert photography complements his mother's text. Franci begins by reviewing the various phases that Las Vegas has undergone from a city dedicated to gambling to a modern venue of dramatically themed resorts dedicated to mass tourism. She traces the evolution of Las Vegas from its 1940s western phase epitomized by El Rancho Vegas and Hotel Last Frontier and the clubs downtown, to the ""sleek supper-club architecture"" of the Flamingo, Desert Inn, and Sands, before addressing the mega-resort trend of recent decades (p. 26). Her book is firmly set in the literature of postmodern architecture and Las Vegas history. Indeed, she moves the field of inquiry popularized by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour in the 1970s, and extended by Alan Hess, Frances Anderton, and John Chase in the 1990s, in a new direction partially inspired by Manfred Pfister's edited work on the ""Italies"" of British travelers.[1]",Art,4,0,giovanna franci offer provocative interpretation la vega appeal colorful work featuring numerous photograph building statue object alongside authentic inspiration italy federico zignanis expert photography complement mother text franci begin reviewing various phase la vega undergone city dedicated gambling modern venue dramatically themed resort dedicated mass tourism trace evolution la vega western phase epitomized el rancho vega hotel last frontier club downtown sleek supperclub architecture flamingo desert inn sand addressing megaresort trend recent decade p book firmly set literature postmodern architecture la vega history indeed move field inquiry popularized robert venturi denise scott brown steven izenour extended alan hess france anderton john chase new direction partially inspired manfred pfisters edited work italy british traveler

For thousands of years Jews and Christians alike have preserved it in the canon of scripture and used it in liturgy. Exegetes saw it as a central text for allegorical interpretations, and so the Song of Songs has exerted an enormous influence on spirituality and mysticism in the Western tradition. In the Voice of My Beloved, E. Ann Matter focuses on the most fertile moment of Song of Songs interpretation: the Middle Ages. At least eighty Latin commentaries on the text survive from the period. In tracing the evolution of these commentaries, Matter reveals them to be a vehicle for expressing changing medieval ideas about the church, the relationship between body and soul, and human and divine love. She shows that the commentaries constitute a well-defined genre of medieval Latin literature. And in discussing the exegesis of the Song of Songs, she takes into account the modern exegesis of the book and feminist critiques of the theology embodied in the text.",Art,4,0,song song eight chapter love lyric found collection wisdom literature attributed solomon enigmatic book bible thousand year jew christian alike preserved canon scripture used liturgy exegete saw central text allegorical interpretation song song exerted enormous influence spirituality mysticism western tradition voice beloved e ann matter focus fertile moment song song interpretation middle age least eighty latin commentary text survive period tracing evolution commentary matter reveals vehicle expressing changing medieval idea church relationship body soul human divine love show commentary constitute welldefined genre medieval latin literature discussing exegesis song song take account modern exegesis book feminist critique theology embodied text

The modes and forms of a cinema of attractions, which form what is here referred to as the practice of documentary display, did not disappear with the ascendency of Griersonian documentary; instead such approaches continued to inform avant-garde film. This paper examines the connections between nonfiction documentations and avant-garde film- and the resultant implications of this meeting for documentary film theory- through an analysis of the film and critical writings of Jean Painleve (1902-1989). Painleve, whom, according to Bazin, 'occupies a singular and privileged place in French cinema', informed his understandings of documentary through contact with, among others, Bunuel, Man Ray, Bataille, Eisenstein, and Grierson. The analysis of Painleve's surrealist documentary display and his extensive body of critical literature on documentary foregrounds overlooked documentary works and constructs, or resurrects, ignored perspectives on documentary film as a way of extending and revising documentary film theory and the documentary canon.",Art,1,0,griersons theory documentary film socalled cinema attraction relegated position lower form contrast description documentary form civic pedagogy mode form cinema attraction form referred practice documentary display disappear ascendency griersonian documentary instead approach continued inform avantgarde film paper examines connection nonfiction documentation avantgarde film resultant implication meeting documentary film theory analysis film critical writing jean painleve painleve according bazin occupies singular privileged place french cinema informed understanding documentary contact among others bunuel man ray bataille eisenstein grierson analysis painleves surrealist documentary display extensive body critical literature documentary foreground overlooked documentary work construct resurrects ignored perspective documentary film way extending revising documentary film theory documentary canon

Though Walt Disney was a cartoonist and not a musician, music was given a distinct, almost central, role in the creation of his cartoons. Special techniques such as Mickey-mousing or the click track were developed by composers and used to synchronize this music and animation. These processes really began with Disney and have formed the basis for all music synchronized to cartoon animation. From the very beginning with Mickey Mouse, to The Silly Symphonies, to the beloved classic Disney movies music has been an ever-present and developing center. Walt Disney, though not a composer himself, hired a number of key composers from which we have many cherished melodies. Unlike most other cartoons Disney’s were focused on using music of the classical style rather than the popular style. The music from a number of classical composers was used or drawn upon as a model. Disney had a special purpose for the music in his animated films. Most of his films contained a story other than the music, but his movie Fantasia really seeks to find the purpose music itself has with visual interpretation. College students have done research on these ideas of simply listening to music or listening while seeing an image. All of Disney’s animated films would not be the classics they are without the music that holds them together. Disney music has become recognized as its own individual art form. It has inspired America to dream and to think more deeply than realized.

Initial examination revealed that it had been heavily over-restored in the nineteenth century. All these additions were removed during cleaning.

42,ab6c377ef5c24cdc99ff940c39f7c0a389c74c8f,Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet,"Michelangelo Buonarroti's influence upon baroque sculpture is now widely recognised by historians. Ever since that morning in 1506 when he and the Sangalli, father and son, watched the white Pentelic marble of the Laokoön emerge from the farmland of Felice de Freddis near the Baths of Titus, Michelangelo's restless mind found authority in antiquity for a revision of his aesthetic canons. In this agonising group Michelangelo found justification for moving beyond the symmetry, restraint, and proportione divina of the Donatellian mode of sculpture, the static scientism of Da Vinci's painting, and the Vitruvian rules of architecture—even though he paid lip service to those rules and even recited them to popes. Whereas Michelangelo did not acknowledge this influence in writing, or apparently in speaking, his contorted and anguished Haman (1511–12) on the spandrel of the Sistine Vault was an admission of the influence of this Rhodian group —just as El Greco's newly-restored Laokoön in Washington acknowledges it as the one work of art which initiated European baroque. Moreover, the anguishes of the Vatican Laokoön and the expressions thereof were to parallel those tensions—visible even in his death mask—of Michelangelo's own soul and to leave an imprint upon his poetry. Laokoön, it should be remembered in view of his impact upon European baroque, was a militant, ritualistic priest.",Art,4,0,michelangelo buonarrotis influence upon baroque sculpture widely recognised historian ever since morning sangalli father son watched white pentelic marble laokoön emerge farmland felice de freddis near bath titus michelangelo restless mind found authority antiquity revision aesthetic canon agonising group michelangelo found justification moving beyond symmetry restraint proportione divina donatellian mode sculpture static scientism da vincis painting vitruvian rule architectureeven though paid lip service rule even recited pope whereas michelangelo acknowledge influence writing apparently speaking contorted anguished haman spandrel sistine vault admission influence rhodian group el greco newlyrestored laokoön washington acknowledges one work art initiated european baroque moreover anguish vatican laokoön expression thereof parallel tensionsvisible even death maskof michelangelo soul leave imprint upon poetry laokoön remembered view impact upon european baroque militant ritualistic priest

Through a textual analysis I'll try to demonstrate how Sun Yu relevantly contributed to the globalization of this language - or ""Americanization"" if we consider Hollywood a synonymous for ""American"", and Hollywood mode of production a transcultural enterprise made by a collage of expertise, as well as a vertical, assembly line-production process.",Art,5,0,intend preliminary analysis code hollywood narrative cinema arrived china code developed suit local standard one prominent movie maker golden age chinese cinema consciously admittedly introduced hollywood technique style production reception national cinema via lyric yet realist popular yet informed consistent yet variegated cinematographic style referring pioneer director sun yu 孫瑜 textual analysis ill try demonstrate sun yu relevantly contributed globalization language americanization consider hollywood synonymous american hollywood mode production transcultural enterprise made collage expertise well vertical assembly lineproduction process

This expanded edition of a special issue of the ""South Atlantic Quarterly"" brings together scholars from various parts of the globe to discuss socialist realism as it appears across genres in art, architecture, film, and literature and across geographic divides - from the 'centre,' Russia, to various points at the 'periphery' - China, Germany, France, Poland, remote republics of the former USSR, and the United States.The contributors argue that socialist realism has never been a monolithic art form and demonstrate, among other things, that its literature could accommodate psychoanalytic criticism; that its art and architecture could affect the aesthetic dictates of Moscow that made 'Soviet' art paradoxically heterogeneous; and that its aesthetics could accommodate both high art and crafted kitsch. ""Socialist Realism without Shores"" also addresses the critical discourse provoked by socialist realism - Stalinist aesthetics, 'anthropological' readings; ideology critique and censorship; and the sublimely ironic approaches adapted from sots art, the Soviet version of postmodernism.

Indeed, it soon became evident that if meaning with any degree of resonance was to be arrived at, such a technique had to be abandoned in favour of an interpretative analysis in relation to myths and praise songs on the one hand, and the observation of the use of sculpture in ritual on the other. Résumé LES SCULPTURES ET LES MYTHES D'ESHU-ELEGBA, LE FOURBE YORUBA: DÉFINITION ET INTERPRÉTATION DANS L'ICONOGRAPHIE YORUBA Les formes sculptées d'Eshu-Elegba, le fourbe Yoruba ou dieu de l'espièglerie, sont présentées, ainsi que ses rites et certains des mythes et des chansons de louanges renfermant une description de ses caractéristiques et de ses activités. Dans la société Yoruba, le fourbe est employé pour fournir une explication d'une conduite déviatrice; il constitue l'extériorisation des difficultés du conformisme. Il est également l'ennemi de la stagnation. Il a une fonction explicative dans la cosmologie Yoruba, car il témoigne que, bien que les gens soient bien informés par l'oracle Ifa, ses activités trouveront sûrement un chemin et exigeront une mise au point continuelle. Cependant, Eshu-Elegba ne constitue pas l'espièglerie au hasard, ni simplement ‘la colère des dieux’; il est également, sous son aspect positif, associé avec la productivité, le changement et la croissance. Ses symboles sont examinés et leur signification est interprétée au moyen des mythes, des chansons et des rites et aux termes des valeurs et du fonctionnement de la culture. Dans la présentation de sa nature ambiguë, des contradictions inhérentes sont examinées, et dans l'analyse de ses symboles certaines agrégations se dégagent. Il est constaté que la cohérence de ces agrégations s'appuie largement sur le principe de la redondance et que la signification d'un élément constitutif quelconque est rendue claire par rapport aux autres.

A fifth sculpture related to the Lesser Dedication in Athens (i.e., the mounted Amazon killing a barbarian now in the Palazzo Massimo in Rome) is carved from Carrara marble. To identify the marble of the Large Gauls with confidence it was necessary to find a means to discriminate clearly between Docimian marble and the white marbles of the newly discovered quarry at Göktepe near Aphrodisias. The usual multi-method approach for marble identification, which combines petrographic, isotopic, and electron paramagnetic resonance data, proved to be unsuitable in this case. Additional techniques were tested, and the answer proved to be strontium trace analysis.

mandalic structure, and the various nineteenth-century optical toys that were vital stages 
in bringing movement to cinema; and examines if the aesthetic links between them are 
coincidental or may be the result of a discontinuous historical trajectory. Research 
findings indicates that ancient items that have been found in archaeological digs from 
Persia hold a significant clue and may be an important piece of the jigsaw of 
understanding the antecedents of film and moving image—in particular, animation. This 
thesis builds on an iconographic analysis of a selection of historical artefacts from 
Persia and compares and contrasts them with the nineteenth century optical toys such as 
the zoetrope and phenakistoscope. These theoretical and historical dimensions have 
been incorporated into the creative practice exploring the above associations creatively 
and affectively. Farsh-e-Parandeh (roughly translated as ‘Flying Carpet’ from Farsi), as 
an animated aerial-projected installation —a moving-image version of a traditional 
Persian carpet— reflects renowned philosopher Attar’s Conference of the Birds (AD 
1177) as a reference point for mandalic structures of Persian and Sufi mystical stories. 
Farsh-e-Parandeh challenges the notion of moving-image production history as a 
necessarily linear projection. This installation instead constructs an immersive, holistic 
engagement based on cyclic patterned arrangements that harken back to nineteenthcentury 
moving image forms of early animations.",Art,5,0,thesis probe association ancient persian art circular mandalic structure various nineteenthcentury optical toy vital stage bringing movement cinema examines aesthetic link coincidental may result discontinuous historical trajectory research finding indicates ancient item found archaeological dig persia hold significant clue may important piece jigsaw understanding antecedent film moving imagein particular animation thesis build iconographic analysis selection historical artefact persia compare contrast nineteenth century optical toy zoetrope phenakistoscope theoretical historical dimension incorporated creative practice exploring association creatively affectively farsheparandeh roughly translated flying carpet farsi animated aerialprojected installation movingimage version traditional persian carpet reflects renowned philosopher attar conference bird ad reference point mandalic structure persian sufi mystical story farsheparandeh challenge notion movingimage production history necessarily linear projection installation instead construct immersive holistic engagement based cyclic patterned arrangement harken back nineteenthcentury moving image form early animation
86,9ec7f87e478242d462a3be769422e2debb6699bf,Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video,"Experimental film and ethnographic film have long been considered separate, autonomous practices on the margins of mainstream cinema. By exploring the interplay between the two forms, Catherine Russell throws new light on both the avant-garde and visual anthropology.

Russell provides detailed analyses of more than thirty-five films and videos from the 1890s to the 1990s and discusses a wide range of film and videomakers, including Georges Melies, Maya Deren, Peter Kubelka, Ray Birdwhistell, Jean Rouch, Su Friedrich, Bill Viola, Kidlat Tahimik, Margaret Mead, Tracey Moffatt, and Chantal Akerman. Arguing that video enables us to see film differently—not as a vanishing culture but as bodies inscripted in technology, Russell maps the slow fade from modernism to postmodern practices. Combining cultural critique with aesthetic analysis, she explores the dynamics of historical interruption, recovery, and reevaluation. As disciplinary boundaries dissolve, Russell contends, ethnography is a means of renewing the avant-gardism of “experimental” film, of mobilizing its play with language and form for historical ends. “Ethnography” likewise becomes an expansive term in which culture is represented from many different and fragmented perspectives.

Original in both its choice of subject and its theoretical and methodological

approaches, Experimental Ethnography will appeal to visual anthropologists, as well as film scholars interested in experimental and documentary practices.",Art,2,0,experimental film ethnographic film long considered separate autonomous practice margin mainstream cinema exploring interplay two form catherine russell throw new light avantgarde visual anthropology russell provides detailed analysis thirtyfive film video discus wide range film videomakers including george melies maya deren peter kubelka ray birdwhistell jean rouch su friedrich bill viola kidlat tahimik margaret mead tracey moffatt chantal akerman arguing video enables u see film differentlynot vanishing culture body inscripted technology russell map slow fade modernism postmodern practice combining cultural critique aesthetic analysis explores dynamic historical interruption recovery reevaluation disciplinary boundary dissolve russell contends ethnography mean renewing avantgardism experimental film mobilizing play language form historical end ethnography likewise becomes expansive term culture represented many different fragmented perspective original choice subject theoretical methodological approach experimental ethnography appeal visual anthropologist well film scholar interested experimental documentary practice

Unlike his fellow stars, he despised the commercial films he made, and engaged with the surrealists and their sympathizers, leading to his role as the Man in Un chien andalou in 1929. In this article, we argue that Batcheff's performance style, which more often than not involved distancing himself from the action and from his female screen partners, and his star persona as the exotic other, contributed to make him what might seem like a contradiction in terms: a surrealist star. We show how the ideological preoccupations of the surrealists at the end of the 1920s, whether in relation to literature (Breton), painting (Dalí), or cinema (Artaud), intersected with those of Batcheff, making him an exemplary uncanny object, as defined by Hal Foster's work on surrealism.",Art,4,0,abstract pierre batcheff one foremost jeunes premier cinema unlike fellow star despised commercial film made engaged surrealist sympathizer leading role man un chien andalou article argue batcheffs performance style often involved distancing action female screen partner star persona exotic contributed make might seem like contradiction term surrealist star show ideological preoccupation surrealist end whether relation literature breton painting dalí cinema artaud intersected batcheff making exemplary uncanny object defined hal foster work surrealism

Was El imagined in the form of an enthroned, benevolent patriarch or a majestic bull or even a solid block of stone?

Methodologically, the chapter examines the misuse of comparative iconography prior to articulating criteria for determining whether a material object represents the divine. The numerous cults of standing stones or masseboth (known elsewhere as betyls or “houses of El”) attested archaeologically throughout Iron Age Israel’s history are discussed including at the key sites of Shechem, the so-called “Bull Site,” Hazor, Arad, Tel Dan and Khirbet Ataruz.

Mathematicians throughout history have created shapes, forms, and relationships, and some of these can be expressed visually. Computer technology allows us to visualise mathematical forms and relationships in new detail using, among other techniques, 3D modelling and animation. The Visual Mind proposes to compare the visual ideas of artists and mathematicians - not to collect abstract thoughts on a general theme, but to allow one point of view to encounter another. The contributors, who include art historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson and filmmaker Peter Greenaway, examine mathematics and aesthetics; geometry and art; mathematics and art; geometry, computer graphics, and art; and visualisation and cinema.

Summary: 
There are many stories, and histories, of animation film. Yet there are other ways of telling a story of animation that peel back and go below the material, historical and factual surface of this cinematic technique. Because the seven thematic concepts of Watch Me Move have a specific thematic focus, it allows permeation between different animation techniques and historically and stylistically discrete canons. This essay concentrates on four of the themes that consider the viewer's experience of animation: apparitions, structures, fragments and visions. Many works in these themes share certain features, properties and experiential phenomena for viewers. They tend to: undermine conventional narrative; lack dialogue and are sound and music driven; feature imaginative, impossible 'worlds' and non-anthropomorphic figures; offer philosophical/perceptual concepts that diverge from our everyday experience of 'reality', and they are often self-reflexive. Tex Avery, one of the most radical Hollywood cartoon directors, is purported to have said ""You can do anything in an animated cartoon."" Looking beyond the cartoon, this essay reveals the fabulous experimentation of some of the exhibition's works that fall outside the realm of commercial popular culture, foregrounding the viewers' experience of the creative imagination that the animated form presents.",Art,5,0,catalogue essay watch move animation show barbican london summary many story history animation film yet way telling story animation peel back go material historical factual surface cinematic technique seven thematic concept watch move specific thematic focus allows permeation different animation technique historically stylistically discrete canon essay concentrate four theme consider viewer experience animation apparition structure fragment vision many work theme share certain feature property experiential phenomenon viewer tend undermine conventional narrative lack dialogue sound music driven feature imaginative impossible world nonanthropomorphic figure offer philosophicalperceptual concept diverge everyday experience reality often selfreflexive tex avery one radical hollywood cartoon director purported said anything animated cartoon looking beyond cartoon essay reveals fabulous experimentation exhibition work fall outside realm commercial popular culture foregrounding viewer experience creative imagination animated form present

This article illustrates the theory of EIS along with its potential for application in the evaluation of protective coatings for outdoor bronze sculpture and ornamentation. Three coating systems were evaluated on a monumental cast bronze: a microcrystalline wax; the methyl methacrylate copolymer sold under the trade name Incralac; and an acrylic/acrylic urethane topcoat. Each coating system was aged using accelerated weathering and evaluated via EIS. This information was then used to calculate the impedance modulus of the samples, which is displayed in Bode plots and interpreted in terms of coating performance.",Art,5,0,abstract electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis technique quantitatively measure amount corrosion protection provided coating metal substrate article illustrates theory eis along potential application evaluation protective coating outdoor bronze sculpture ornamentation three coating system evaluated monumental cast bronze microcrystalline wax methyl methacrylate copolymer sold trade name incralac acrylicacrylic urethane topcoat coating system aged using accelerated weathering evaluated via eis information used calculate impedance modulus sample displayed bode plot interpreted term coating performance

Theologians often describe mysticism in the medieval West in terms of religious experience that manifests itself through a passive reception of the overwhelming flow of divine grace. Le Dictionnaire de Spiritualité defines mysticism as consisting of two inseparable elements, the penetrating knowledge, or vision, of God and the passionate love of Him, both shed by the Divinity onto the human soul (“... tout état mystique ést constitué par ces deux elements qui ne sont pas séparés: connaissance de Dieu supérieure, mais générale et confuse, et amour très précieux, mais irraisonné, l’un et l’autre directement verses par Dieu dans l’âme.”) On the other hand, the earlier tradition of Christian thinking that I am investigating here contains much less of the passionate religious experience and more of the conscious intellectual cognition of the divine, which very often finds its expression in rather cold intellectual and philosophical terms, so much so that, as in the case of Augustine, Dom Cuthbert Butler finds it valid to ask, whether it is not the “language of an exalted Platonism describing only the higher operations of the intellect? In other words, the question has to be faced: is it Mysticism, or is it Platonism?” Indeed, the Christianity of Late Antiquity and subsequently that of the early Middle Ages (both in the East and in the West) inherited",Art,5,0,different variety mystical experience contemplation divine therefore important know precisely taken object research paper theologian often describe mysticism medieval west term religious experience manifest passive reception overwhelming flow divine grace le dictionnaire de spiritualité defines mysticism consisting two inseparable element penetrating knowledge vision god passionate love shed divinity onto human soul tout état mystique ést constitué par ce deux element qui ne sont pa séparés connaissance de dieu supérieure mais générale et confuse et amour très précieux mais irraisonné lun et lautre directement verse par dieu dans lâme hand earlier tradition christian thinking investigating contains much le passionate religious experience conscious intellectual cognition divine often find expression rather cold intellectual philosophical term much case augustine dom cuthbert butler find valid ask whether language exalted platonism describing higher operation intellect word question faced mysticism platonism indeed christianity late antiquity subsequently early middle age east west inherited

How to transcribe the accurate and authentic text was debated and eventually prescribed in detail in each tradition, but ultimately each religion adopted a different strategy. The Jewish tradition—which distinguishes between liturgical reading and study—developed two discrete formats of the Pentateuch. The ancient form of the scroll with the text inscribed in scripta defectiva was reserved for liturgical use, while the newer codex, written in scripta plena with vocalization and cantillation marks, was accepted for all other purposes. Muslim scholars were less concerned with preserving an ‘authentic’ form, and gradually allowed massive embellishment of the basic script, and a wide variety of designs. The two traditions regard a few early copies of their scriptures, notably the ʿUṯmānī Musḥaf(s) of the Qurʾān and the Aleppo Codex of the Torah, as particularly awe inspiring and holy, according them the role of “master copy” on the scholarly level, and bestowing them the veneration due sacred relics, on the popular level.",Art,3,0,jew muslim developed similar perception divine origin respective sacred scripture including aural graphic form transcribe accurate authentic text debated eventually prescribed detail tradition ultimately religion adopted different strategy jewish traditionwhich distinguishes liturgical reading studydeveloped two discrete format pentateuch ancient form scroll text inscribed scripta defectiva reserved liturgical use newer codex written scripta plenum vocalization cantillation mark accepted purpose muslim scholar le concerned preserving authentic form gradually allowed massive embellishment basic script wide variety design two tradition regard early copy scripture notably ʿuṯmānī musḥafs qurʾān aleppo codex torah particularly awe inspiring holy according role master copy scholarly level bestowing veneration due sacred relic popular level

In one hand, Jencks’ postmodern architecture is criticism on modern and modern-late architecture. Jencks stresses on both differences that modern and modern-late architecture are based on a single coding only and postmodern architecture is based on double coding in their style. In other one, Jencks’ postmodern architecture is a semiotic entity that has to seen as a sign. This research is the figure factual history research. It was based on primary and secondary literature. It used description, interpretation and heuristic method. Jencks’s semiotic conception of postmodern architecture has adopted dualism semiotic of Saussuran like signifier-signified, langue-parole, denotation-connotation, and paradigmatic-sintagmatic.

Instead, it contends that Hollywood departs in important ways from the models of both the restorative nostalgia established by the heritage cinema and Great Britain and the reflective nostalgia commonly found in American literature. Using a wide range of examples from American cinema, American literature, and American culture, it considers the reasons why nostalgia occupies a different place and seeks different kinds of expressions in American culture than it does in other national cultures, examines the leading Hollywood genres in which restorative nostalgia appears and the distinctive ways those genres inflect it, and concludes by urging a closer analysis of the more complex, multi-laminated nostalgia Hollywood films offer as an alternative to Boym’s highly influential categorical dichotomy.",Art,3,0,essay argues complexity nostalgic impulse hollywood cinema inadequately described svetlana boyms particular description hollywood inducing nostalgia offering tranquilizer highly influential general distinction restorative reflective nostalgia instead contends hollywood departs important way model restorative nostalgia established heritage cinema great britain reflective nostalgia commonly found american literature using wide range example american cinema american literature american culture considers reason nostalgia occupies different place seek different kind expression american culture national culture examines leading hollywood genre restorative nostalgia appears distinctive way genre inflect concludes urging closer analysis complex multilaminated nostalgia hollywood film offer alternative boyms highly influential categorical dichotomy

140,0cbd5a5694b76666cdccde645d95249fd9fe3ca4,Why Is That Art?: Aesthetics and Criticism of Contemporary Art,"Why Is That Art? addresses common questions that viewers raise about contemporary art: Why is that art? Why is it in an art museum? Who says it's art? If I did this, would it be art? Why is it good? Covering a broad, diverse, and engaging sampling of works--abstract and representational painting, monumental sculpture, performance art, video installations, films, and photographs--author Terry Barrett responds to these questions using three sources: the artists who created the works, philosophers of art, and art critics. Introducing students to a variety of established theories of art, he presents the traditional sets of criteria of Realism, Expressionism, and Formalism, which are in turn updated by recent sources of Poststructuralism. Barrett applies each of these theories to challenging works of contemporary art, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of each mode of interpretation. He encourages students to consider many criteria when evaluating an artwork, to critically examine judgments made by others, and to make informed judgments of their own. Ideal for courses in aesthetics, art theory, art criticism, and the philosophy of art, Why Is That Art? is organized chronologically according to the history of aesthetics. It features sixty-seven illustrations (twenty-six in a full-color insert), discusses a wide range of American and European artists, and includes an exceptional overview of postmodern pluralism. This unique book will provide students with a newfound appreciation for contemporary art, scholarship, and reasoned argumentation, giving them the confidence to join the fascinating discourse on contemporary art.",Art,5,0,art address common question viewer raise contemporary art art art museum say art would art good covering broad diverse engaging sampling worksabstract representational painting monumental sculpture performance art video installation film photographsauthor terry barrett responds question using three source artist created work philosopher art art critic introducing student variety established theory art present traditional set criterion realism expressionism formalism turn updated recent source poststructuralism barrett applies theory challenging work contemporary art pointing strength weakness mode interpretation encourages student consider many criterion evaluating artwork critically examine judgment made others make informed judgment ideal course aesthetic art theory art criticism philosophy art art organized chronologically according history aesthetic feature sixtyseven illustration twentysix fullcolor insert discus wide range american european artist includes exceptional overview postmodern pluralism unique book provide student newfound appreciation contemporary art scholarship reasoned argumentation giving confidence join fascinating discourse contemporary art

Aims of this analysis are to tease out some ideological and aesthetic tensions that could appear to point, on the one hand, to some formal and thematic continuity between pre-World War II output and that of later years; and, on the other, to the particular role played by technology in shaping a specific formalistic vocabulary in these films.",Art,3,0,abstract essay examines three exemplar case italian industrial cinema genre experienced particular extended apogee decade italy economic boom michelangelo antonionis sette canne un vestito ermanno olmis costruzioni meccaniche riva vittorio de seta franco dodis gela pozzi mare aim analysis tease ideological aesthetic tension could appear point one hand formal thematic continuity preworld war ii output later year particular role played technology shaping specific formalistic vocabulary film

What is the relationship between a cinema of slowness and a wider socio-cultural ""slow movement""? A body of films that shares a propensity toward slowness has emerged in many parts of the world over the past two decades. This is the first book to examine the concept of cinematic slowness and address this fascinating phenomenon in contemporary film culture. Providing a critical investigation into questions of temporality, materiality, and aesthetics, and examining concepts of authorship, cinephilia, and nostalgia, Song Hwee Lim offers insight into cinematic slowness through the films of the Malaysian-born, Taiwan-based director Tsai Ming-liang. Through detailed analysis of aspects of stillness and silence in cinema, Lim delineates the strategies by which slowness in film can be constructed. By drawing on writings on cinephilia and the films of directors such as Abbas Kiarostami, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Nuri Bilge Ceylan, he makes a passionate case for a slow cinema that calls for renewed attention to the image and to the experience of time in film. Tsai Ming-Liang and a Cinema of Slowness will speak to readers with an interest in art cinema, queer studies, East Asian culture, and the question of time. In an age of unrelenting acceleration of pace both in film and in life, this book invites us to pause and listen, to linger and look, and, above all, to take things slowly.",Art,2,0,qualify slowness cinema relationship cinema slowness wider sociocultural slow movement body film share propensity toward slowness emerged many part world past two decade first book examine concept cinematic slowness address fascinating phenomenon contemporary film culture providing critical investigation question temporality materiality aesthetic examining concept authorship cinephilia nostalgia song hwee lim offer insight cinematic slowness film malaysianborn taiwanbased director tsai mingliang detailed analysis aspect stillness silence cinema lim delineates strategy slowness film constructed drawing writing cinephilia film director abbas kiarostami hou hsiaohsien nuri bilge ceylan make passionate case slow cinema call renewed attention image experience time film tsai mingliang cinema slowness speak reader interest art cinema queer study east asian culture question time age unrelenting acceleration pace film life book invite u pause listen linger look take thing slowly

This essay surveys the spatial and architectural framework of the Circus Maximus, the primary chariot racing venue at Rome, and circuses around the empire; the organization of the races, including the role of the factions; the symbolic representations of victories and athletic victors, as well as the charioteers’ actual prizes; and the horses that were bred for racing. Throughout I also briefly discuss the sport’s spectators and fans, for whom the sport was a socially binding religion. The essay focuses on the first through the fourth centuries A.D., with the bulk of the evidence (literary, epigraphic, artistic, and archaeological) drawn from the first two centuries. In keeping with current directions in the study of ancient sport and spectacle, the approach adopted here places less emphasis on the legal and technical aspects of the chariot races (‘event-oriented sport history’) and more on these competitions as ‘part of a broader social canvas’ (the ‘social history of sport and spectacle’).",Art,5,0,abstract chariot race earliest popular longestlived form spectacle roman world essay survey spatial architectural framework circus maximus primary chariot racing venue rome circus around empire organization race including role faction symbolic representation victory athletic victor well charioteer actual prize horse bred racing throughout also briefly discus sport spectator fan sport socially binding religion essay focus first fourth century ad bulk evidence literary epigraphic artistic archaeological drawn first two century keeping current direction study ancient sport spectacle approach adopted place le emphasis legal technical aspect chariot race eventoriented sport history competition part broader social canvas social history sport spectacle

150,809094b3177ba7232e01f04e69364e48b598670f,Vocal Apparitions: The Attraction of Cinema to Opera,"Cinema and opera have become intertwined in a variety of powerful and unusual ways. Vocal Apparitions tells the story of this fascinating intersection, interprets how it occurred, and explores what happens when opera is projected onto the medium of film. Michal Grover-Friedlander finds striking affinities between film and opera--from Lon Chaney's classic silent film, The Phantom of the Opera, to the Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera to Fellini's E la nave va. One of the guiding questions of this book is what occurs when what is aesthetically essential about one medium is transposed into the aesthetic field of the other. For example, Grover-Friedlander's comparison of an opera by Poulenc and a Rossellini film, both based on Cocteau's play The Human Voice, shows the relation of the vocal and the visual to be surprisingly affected by the choice of the medium. Her analysis of the Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera demonstrates how, as a response to opera's infatuation with death, cinema comically acts out a correction of opera's fate. Grover-Friedlander argues that filmed operas such as Zeffirelli's Otello and Friedrich's Falstaff show the impossibility of a direct transformation of the operatic into the cinematic. Paradoxically, cinema at times can be more operatic than opera itself, thus capturing something essential that escapes opera's self-understanding. A remarkable look at how cinema has been haunted--and transformed--by opera, Vocal Apparitions reveals something original and important about each medium.",Art,5,0,cinema opera become intertwined variety powerful unusual way vocal apparition tell story fascinating intersection interprets occurred explores happens opera projected onto medium film michal groverfriedlander find striking affinity film operafrom lon chaneys classic silent film phantom opera marx brother night opera fellini e la nave va one guiding question book occurs aesthetically essential one medium transposed aesthetic field example groverfriedlanders comparison opera poulenc rossellini film based cocteau play human voice show relation vocal visual surprisingly affected choice medium analysis marx brother night opera demonstrates response opera infatuation death cinema comically act correction opera fate groverfriedlander argues filmed opera zeffirellis otello friedrichs falstaff show impossibility direct transformation operatic cinematic paradoxically cinema time operatic opera thus capturing something essential escape opera selfunderstanding remarkable look cinema hauntedand transformedby opera vocal apparition reveals something original important medium

And from man's sacrifice and dismemberment came the entire world, including the hierarchical ordering of human society. The Head Beneath the Altar is the first book to present a wide-ranging study of Hindu texts read through the lens of Rene Girard's mimetic theory of the sacrificial origin of religion and culture. For those interested in Girard and comparative religion, the book also performs a careful reading of Girard's work, drawing connections between his thought and the work of theorists like Georges Dumezil and Giorgio Agamben. Brian Collins examines the idea of sacrifice from the earliest recorded rituals through the flowering of classical mythology and the ancient Indian institutions of the duel, the oath, and the secret warrior society. He also uncovers implicit and explicit critiques in the tradition, confirming Girard's intuition that Hinduism offers an alternative anti-sacrificial worldview to the one contained in the gospels.",Art,4,0,beginning say ancient hindu text rg veda man man sacrifice dismemberment came entire world including hierarchical ordering human society head beneath altar first book present wideranging study hindu text read lens rene girard mimetic theory sacrificial origin religion culture interested girard comparative religion book also performs careful reading girard work drawing connection thought work theorist like george dumezil giorgio agamben brian collins examines idea sacrifice earliest recorded ritual flowering classical mythology ancient indian institution duel oath secret warrior society also uncovers implicit explicit critique tradition confirming girard intuition hinduism offer alternative antisacrificial worldview one contained gospel

The Judeo-Christian God has been relegated as a figure of the past and characterized as a later development from the polytheistic religions of the Ancient Near East into a monotheism that would eventually evolve into the secular atheistic society we have today. This caricatured view of God has been predominate in our western society and has been deeply caricaturized by scholars in the humanities and the sciences. Due to these assumptions, this paper seeks to reassess these claims in light of their historical factuality. The methodology we have employed in our work is a comparative study between the portrayals of the monotheistic father God in the Psalms by the Hebrew authors and that of the polytheistic father gods seen throughout the Ancient Near East. We have restricted our study to the Psalms since it is here were we have a large variety of father imagery in the metaphors employed by the Psalmists. By investigating carefully these passages in the Psalms and comparing them with their Ancient Near Eastern counterparts we will see that the depictions of God are very different from the anthropomorphic notions ascribed to Him by the Ancient Near Eastern cultures.

These conventions and their ideological are conveyed to the reader through close readings of select scenes. To further achieve this, the author resorts to the notion of ‘border syndrome’, coined by Gazmend Kapllani in his Short Border Handbook and to Hamid Naficy’s meditations on border subjects in his Accented Cinema, and argues that Hostage reimagines the migrant as a tragic outsider, prone to victimhood.",Art,2,0,giannariss film provides original evocation border crossing reimagining hijacking intercity bus greece clandestine albanian migrant endured police brutality greece chapter affords indepth analysis film form thematic preoccupation comprehend issue mobility essential cinematic migrant journey author argues film layered use onscreen offscreen mobility reveal politics transnational migration impact migrant body convention ideological conveyed reader close reading select scene achieve author resort notion border syndrome coined gazmend kapllani short border handbook hamid naficys meditation border subject accented cinema argues hostage reimagines migrant tragic outsider prone victimhood

The first is the capture of still photoreal images in a chemical medium, known as photography. The second is the exploration of making graphic images appear to move, encapsulated in a series of amusement devices, which became known as philosophical or optical toys (Wyver, 1989 and Nowell-Smith, 1997). The Daguerrotype and Niepce images (see Figures 1 and 2) depict the way that the formative history of cinema is usually portrayed.

Schefer's philosophy of cinema offers a very personal understanding of how the ‘ordinary person’ experiences cinema and, in particular, how individual films have the ability to shape personal interactions with history and culture, forming an ‘inner history’ that has been a part and continues to be a part of twentieth-century existential being, often confronting us with the more difficult moments and events in recent human history.",Art,3,0,jean louis schefer one le wellknown french philosopher cinema yet seminal work lhomme ordinaire du cinéma gone largely unnoticed angloamerican criticism influential french film thinking paper set frame schefers work manner make accessible unconventional manner analysis cinema history schefers philosophy cinema offer personal understanding ordinary person experience cinema particular individual film ability shape personal interaction history culture forming inner history part continues part twentiethcentury existential often confronting u difficult moment event recent human history

I draw particularly on José Antonio Maravall to advance a schema of recurring Baroque characteristics – fictionalising, hyperbole, melancholy, kitsch and plateauing. Some concepts will seem unfamiliar to scholars used to considering the Baroque as primarily concerned with music, painting or sculpture, or inextricably connected with the Counter-Reformation. These concepts are concerned less with the surface characteristics of the period’s culture and more with underlying ideological trends. I also ask how we can speak of the ‘English’ Baroque, since it has long seemed an alien concept to the residual tradition of English literary and cultural history.",Art,1,0,chapter survey current theory baroque distinguishing see historically view recurring stylistic quirk draw particularly josé antonio maravall advance schema recurring baroque characteristic fictionalising hyperbole melancholy kitsch plateauing concept seem unfamiliar scholar used considering baroque primarily concerned music painting sculpture inextricably connected counterreformation concept concerned le surface characteristic period culture underlying ideological trend also ask speak english baroque since long seemed alien concept residual tradition english literary cultural history

By drawing attention to the film’s depiction of cannibalism, rape and real animal slaughter, the chapter highlights the similarities it shares with other extreme texts, repositioning it within the boarder extreme art film tradition outlined throughout the book. To find out whether this reputation impacts the commercial identity of the film, the chapter moves on to explore the paratextuality of the film. Ultimately concluding that the film’s distributors (Artificial Eye) offer a hybridised object that flirts with extremity, the chapter then examines Ruggero Deodato’s Cannibal Holocaust. Noting similarities between the films, the chapter provides a detailed analysis of Shameless Screen Entertainment collectors’ edition DVD. Showing how the paratextual material re-constructs the film’s history, the analysis argues that Cannibal Holocaust’s remediation moves it away from an exploitation film ghetto by employing traditionally highbrow marketing techniques.

However, it was immediately recognized that no amount ofhermeneutics would persuade the out-and-out atheist. So an alternative strategy was developed in order to prove the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and other principles of faith on 'natural' grounds. Perhaps the most familiar form of this natural theology can be seen in the attempts to prove the existence of God by vast and detailed elaborations of the cosmological argument or the argument from design.2 But there was also a major philosophical effort to prove the immortality of the soul and the reality of life after death on purely rational or commonsense grounds, in order to persuade or remind the atheist who was regarded as thoroughly antisocial that he must face a future reckoning for his present misdeeds. One of the most important philosophical theologians engaged in this effort was the Cambridge Platonist, Henry More (1614-87). In the early part of his career (from 1642 to 1659), More published a series of philosophical works intended to combat atheism on a number of different fronts. It is easy to see, however, that the nature of the human soul engaged most of his attention; from The Platonicall Song of the Soul of 1642 to The Immortality",Art,5,0,atheism greatly increase seventeenth century many devout contemporary believed supposed challenge attempt establish principle true faith stimulated proliferation exegetical study regarded characteristic postreformation scholarship however immediately recognized amount ofhermeneutics would persuade outandout atheist alternative strategy developed order prove existence god immortality soul principle faith natural ground perhaps familiar form natural theology seen attempt prove existence god vast detailed elaboration cosmological argument argument design also major philosophical effort prove immortality soul reality life death purely rational commonsense ground order persuade remind atheist regarded thoroughly antisocial must face future reckoning present misdeed one important philosophical theologian engaged effort cambridge platonist henry early part career published series philosophical work intended combat atheism number different front easy see however nature human soul engaged attention platonicall song soul immortality

192,d2bc5328d1bbf4dd0cad178921d713c46f4ff20c,Transatlantic Dialogue: Contemporary Art in and Out of Africa,"""Transatlantic Dialogue"" opens an exciting cultural dialogue at the crossroads where Western and African art traditions intersect. Despite diversity of media, technique, and form, these contemporary African and African American art works and the artists who created them are united by a rich network of connections, exchanges, and associations generated from both shores of the Middle Passage. Collected in this book are 24 color reproductions of the art of seven African artists: Skunder Boghossian, Sokari Douglas Camp, Rashid Diab, Amir Nour, Moyo Ogundipe, Moyo Okediji, and Ouattara - and seven African American artists: Jean-Michel Basquiat, John Biggers, Jeff Donaldson, Yvonne Edwards-Tucker, Winnie Owens-Hart, Charles Searles, and Al Smith. Paintings, mixed media, sculptures, and ceramics reflect issues of identity while expressing beauty, pulsating rhythms, and a sense of improvisation among bursts of colour and quieter, more contemplative moments. American artist and scholar Michael D. Harris and Nigerian artist and scholar Moyo Okediji construct a dialogue in companion essays that explore departures and arrivals, connections and distinctions between contemporary African and African American artists.

194,17c425fedc53130d4cfc1fbfa909e2ced1f42c06,The independence of the Manx Church,"In this paper, Dr Augur Pearce considers the legal basis on which the Diocese of Sodor and Man can be said to be integrated into the Church of England. 
 
England and Man were by origin two quite separate jurisdictions, and although the medieval view of the church as one supranational hierarchy centred on Rome would make this fact irrelevant, the Reformation theory of national churches would point to a prima facie autonomous Manx Church, unless and until steps were taken to unite the English and Manx religious systems. The paper therefore considers the evidence for a pre-Reformation link to the province of Canterbury, the legal basis for the Reformation changes in preaching and liturgy, and the (limited) effect of the transfer of metropolitical oversight to York in 1541. 
 
The real agent of integration, it is argued, has been nineteenth and twentieth century Westminster legislation. Behind the unquestioned factual Manx adherence to the English Church lies the authority of the Parliament of England over the Isle of Man. Even here, though, the normal rules for determining whether a Westminster enactment is intended to extend to the Island must apply, irrespective of whether that enactment be a traditional Act or a Measure framed in Church Assembly or General Synod.",Art,5,0,paper dr augur pearce considers legal basis diocese sodor man said integrated church england england man origin two quite separate jurisdiction although medieval view church one supranational hierarchy centred rome would make fact irrelevant reformation theory national church would point prima facie autonomous manx church unless step taken unite english manx religious system paper therefore considers evidence prereformation link province canterbury legal basis reformation change preaching liturgy limited effect transfer metropolitical oversight york real agent integration argued nineteenth twentieth century westminster legislation behind unquestioned factual manx adherence english church lie authority parliament england isle man even though normal rule determining whether westminster enactment intended extend island must apply irrespective whether enactment traditional act measure framed church assembly general synod

This book provides a critical analysis of the cinematic representation of fatness during this timeframe, specifically in contemporary Hollywood cinema, with emphasis on the intersection of gender, race and fatness. The analysis is based on around 50 films released since 2000 and includes examples such as Transformers, Precious, Kung Fu Panda, Paul Blart and Pitch Perfect. Barbara Plotz provides a mapping of the common cinematic tropes of fatness and also shows how commonplace notions of fatness that are part of the current ‘‘obesity epidemic’’ discourse are reflected in these tropes.

Genes identified include the β myosin heavy chain gene (βMHC) on chromosome 14q1, the troponin T gene on chromosome 1q, and the α tropomyosin gene on chromosome 15q. In addition, a fourth locus is present on chromosome 11q11, but the gene remains to be identified. More than 35 missense mutations in the βMHC, 3 mutations in troponin T, and 2 mutations in α tropomyosin gene in HCM patients have been identified. Functional studies have shown that the mutant βMHC protein has impaired actomyosin interaction and that expression of the mutant myosin disrupts the assembly of sarcomere in feline cardiocytes. Genotype-phenotype correlations of βMHC mutations have shown that mutations such as Arg403Gln, Arg453Cys, and Arg719Trp are associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death and a significantly decreased life expectancy, whereas mutations Gly256Glu and Leu908Val have a near-normal life span.

Rathke as early as 1839 observed the continuity of the columella and hyoid arch in snakes. The comparative anatomy of the lacertilian columella auris has been exhaustively studied by Versluys ('03) and was shown by him to be composed of two morphologically distinct parts, a median segment, the stapes, closing the fenestra vestibuli, and a lateral segment, the extracolumella, which remains cartilaginous through life and whose outer end is attached to the tympanic membrane. The independence in origin of columella and otic capsule has not been recognized, however, by all investigators although at the present time the evidence is quite convincing that the columella auris is entirely extra-capsular in origin. In Lacertilia, according to Versluys, the extracolumella apparently takes part in the completion of the hyoid arch and in fact i t has been termed the hyostapes by Hoffman ('89) in contradistinction to the otostapes, which that investigator regarded as of labyrinthine origin. I n Testudo, according to Bender (,ll), the columella is united with the hyale by means of the interhyale and the extracolumella lies wholly external to the arch which is made up of the cornu hyale, interhyale, and columella.

• Pumpkin plants were exposed to 150 nl l−1 of O3 for 5 h d−1 for 5 d. Gas-exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and pigment-content measurements were determined on days 1, 3, 5 for young leaves and days 1, 3, 4 for the mature leaves of control and treated plants. 
• In both young and mature leaves, O3 induced a significant decrease in photosynthetic rate through impacts on stomata and photochemistry. A reduction in PSII photochemistry, photochemical quenching and quantum yield, accompanied by a parallel increase in nonphotochemical quenching was detected. Following O3 treatment the pool of xanthophyll cycle pigments and the de-epoxidation index underwent a significant increase, whereas chlorophylls and β-carotene were less affected.

Rathke as early as 1839 observed the continuity of the columella and hyoid arch in snakes. The comparative anatomy of the lacertilian columella auris has been exhaustively studied by Versluys ('03) and was shown by him to be composed of two morphologically distinct parts, a median segment, the stapes, closing the fenestra vestibuli, and a lateral segment, the extracolumella, which remains cartilaginous through life and whose outer end is attached to the tympanic membrane. The independence in origin of columella and otic capsule has not been recognized, however, by all investigators although at the present time the evidence is quite convincing that the columella auris is entirely extra-capsular in origin. In Lacertilia, according to Versluys, the extracolumella apparently takes part in the completion of the hyoid arch and in fact i t has been termed the hyostapes by Hoffman ('89) in contradistinction to the otostapes, which that investigator regarded as of labyrinthine origin. I n Testudo, according to Bender (,ll), the columella is united with the hyale by means of the interhyale and the extracolumella lies wholly external to the arch which is made up of the cornu hyale, interhyale, and columella.

We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First, proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation.",Biology,2,0,major pathway eukaryotic messenger rna mrna turnover begin deadenylation followed decapping exonucleolytic decay provide evidence mrna decapping degradation occur discrete cytoplasmic focus yeast call processing body p body first protein activate catalyze decapping concentrated p body second inhibiting mrna turnover decapping lead loss p body however inhibiting turnover decapping increase abundance size p body finally mrna degradation intermediate localized p body result define flux mrna polysomes p body critical aspect cytoplasmic mrna metabolism possible site regulation mrna degradation
230,38ee08e4c36f55dbbde2e8439dd9a9c9550be8bd,"The language of systematics, and the philosophy of ‘total evidence’","Abstract This contribution analyses the primacy of classification over generalization, and the philosophy of total evidence that emerges from the relation of homology to character statements. Primary conjectures of homology are basic character statements, i.e. statements that predicate properties of organisms, properties that are instantiated by those organisms and/or their parts. Secondary conjectures of homology are embedded in a second‐level (metalinguistic) discourse that turns on the coherence or incoherence of those basic character statements relative to a hierarchy. The coherence or incoherence of character statements is a logical relation between statements, not a causal (historical) relation between organisms. The choice of the hypothesis of relationships that is supported by the largest set of coherent basic character statements is based on the empirical presupposition that the properties referred to by the set of coherent character statements are grounded in causally efficacious relations of inheritance and ontogeny, and co‐instantiated because they are inherited through common ancestry (Hennig's auxiliary principle). Unless that empirical presupposition is causally grounded, phylogeny reconstruction is of an inherently probabilistic nature, whether under parsimony or other models of analysis. The causal grounding of a coherent set of character statements typically seeks a link between character statements and causally efficacious generative mechanisms for morphological characters (as is defeasibly indicated by topology and connectivity), or secondary structure information for molecular characters.",Biology,4,0,abstract contribution analysis primacy classification generalization philosophy total evidence emerges relation homology character statement primary conjecture homology basic character statement ie statement predicate property organism property instantiated organism andor part secondary conjecture homology embedded secondlevel metalinguistic discourse turn coherence incoherence basic character statement relative hierarchy coherence incoherence character statement logical relation statement causal historical relation organism choice hypothesis relationship supported largest set coherent basic character statement based empirical presupposition property referred set coherent character statement grounded causally efficacious relation inheritance ontogeny coinstantiated inherited common ancestry hennigs auxiliary principle unless empirical presupposition causally grounded phylogeny reconstruction inherently probabilistic nature whether parsimony model analysis causal grounding coherent set character statement typically seek link character statement causally efficacious generative mechanism morphological character defeasibly indicated topology connectivity secondary structure information molecular character

Owen attempts to unsettle the implied antagonism between magic and moder nity in this rich contribution to modern British intellectual historiography. Indeed, The Place of Enchantment insists that fin de siecle occultism was a constitutive element—or at least symptomatic—of modern British culture (8). Owen offers a nuanced account of occultism from 1880 until 1914, in which she centralizes ritual magic and magicians in historical accounts of British modernity. She observes that late Victorian and Edwardian England’s “occult preoccupation” constituted “one of the most remarked trends” of the period, as many educated, middle-class white women and men “became absorbed by metaphysical quests, heterodox spiritual encounters, and occult experimentation” (4, 7). Marked interest in medieval and Renaissance Christian mysticism, “heterodox inspirational neo-Christianity,” and nondenominational and/or non-Christian esoteric philosophy characterized this new “spiritual movement of the age” (4). The Place of Enchantment addresses a scholarly lacuna and what Owens terms an “almost willful” scholarly amnesia regarding “the hugely popular occult movement of the turn of the century” (5).

Owen attempts to unsettle the implied antagonism between magic and moder nity in this rich contribution to modern British intellectual historiography. Indeed, The Place of Enchantment insists that fin de siecle occultism was a constitutive element—or at least symptomatic—of modern British culture (8). Owen offers a nuanced account of occultism from 1880 until 1914, in which she centralizes ritual magic and magicians in historical accounts of British modernity. She observes that late Victorian and Edwardian England’s “occult preoccupation” constituted “one of the most remarked trends” of the period, as many educated, middle-class white women and men “became absorbed by metaphysical quests, heterodox spiritual encounters, and occult experimentation” (4, 7). Marked interest in medieval and Renaissance Christian mysticism, “heterodox inspirational neo-Christianity,” and nondenominational and/or non-Christian esoteric philosophy characterized this new “spiritual movement of the age” (4). The Place of Enchantment addresses a scholarly lacuna and what Owens terms an “almost willful” scholarly amnesia regarding “the hugely popular occult movement of the turn of the century” (5). But Owen’s contribution does more than merely correct the occlusion",Biology,5,0,place enchantment british occultism culture modern alex owen note evocative term enchantment neatly capture sense magical numinous state mind seemingly odds modern outlook emphasis added owen attempt unsettle implied antagonism magic moder nity rich contribution modern british intellectual historiography indeed place enchantment insists fin de siecle occultism constitutive elementor least symptomaticof modern british culture owen offer nuanced account occultism centralizes ritual magic magician historical account british modernity observes late victorian edwardian england occult preoccupation constituted one remarked trend period many educated middleclass white woman men became absorbed metaphysical quest heterodox spiritual encounter occult experimentation marked interest medieval renaissance christian mysticism heterodox inspirational neochristianity nondenominational andor nonchristian esoteric philosophy characterized new spiritual movement age place enchantment address scholarly lacuna owen term almost willful scholarly amnesia regarding hugely popular occult movement turn century owen contribution merely correct occlusion

242,5292bf6f3a2dec9a214c3642936972fcb62ad850,Classification and genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition.,"A suggested classification of numeric anomalies of teeth is a trimodal classification: anodontia, hypodontia, and hyperdontia. A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

259,c4ca410c08423ee44d93616b798eeb39fbe3c5e4,XXXIII. Extinct Birds,"The lecturer observed that comparative anatomy showed that birds were more nearly allied to reptiles than to mammals, however striking the external differences between them might be. Hence the late Professor Huxley had included birds and reptiles in one common group—the Sauropsida. Evolutionists believed that birds had originated from reptiles, though it was not known from what order of reptiles they were descended. The resemblances between birds and the Pterodactyles, or winged reptiles of the Jurassic epoch, were merely adaptive, but some of the likewise extinct order of Dinosauria had certainly bird-like osteological peculiarities. It was, however, interesting to know that the oldest known fossil bird—the Archæopteryx of the Upper Jurassic—was more reptile-like than any later bird, inasmuch as it had teeth in its jaws, a less specialised anterior extremity, and the caudal part of the vertebral column was elongated and tapering. The Archæopteryx formed one of the three great divisions into which birds were classed by Huxley—namely, the Saururae, or lizard-tailed; the other two being the Ratitæ, or ostrich-like birds, and the Carinatae, which included the overwhelming majority of living species. The Ratitæ comprised the Ostrich, the Emu, &c, running birds with degenerate wings, and consequently incapable of flight. Remains referred to Ratitæ have been found in Tertiary strata, but the most complete were those from the more recent accumulations, such as the Æpiornis, or Giant Bird, of Madagascar, eggs of which have been found measuring 14 inches in length; and the huge Moas of New Zealand, some of",Biology,3,0,lecturer observed comparative anatomy showed bird nearly allied reptile mammal however striking external difference might hence late professor huxley included bird reptile one common groupthe sauropsida evolutionist believed bird originated reptile though known order reptile descended resemblance bird pterodactyles winged reptile jurassic epoch merely adaptive likewise extinct order dinosauria certainly birdlike osteological peculiarity however interesting know oldest known fossil birdthe archæopteryx upper jurassicwas reptilelike later bird inasmuch teeth jaw le specialised anterior extremity caudal part vertebral column elongated tapering archæopteryx formed one three great division bird classed huxleynamely saururae lizardtailed two ratitæ ostrichlike bird carinatae included overwhelming majority living specie ratitæ comprised ostrich emu c running bird degenerate wing consequently incapable flight remains referred ratitæ found tertiary stratum complete recent accumulation æpiornis giant bird madagascar egg found measuring inch length huge moa new zealand

We see our world writ large in the heavens and tend to place our own face and stamp on everything in nature, including the creatures that share our environment. Particularly for nonliterate cultures, the images perceived in the constellations, as well as the planetary peregrinations among them, serve as an eternal mnemonic record for the recall of the vital oral traditions that maintain those cultures.

A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor
264,166a3e0b9674b08567938eb7445f9ed94bef1d3c,Genome downsizing in polyploid plants,"All else being equal, polyploids are expected to have larger C-values (amount of DNA in the unreplicated gametic nucleus) than their diploid progenitors, increasing in direct proportion with ploidy. This expectation is observed in some polyploid series, especially those newly formed, but there are examples suggesting that C-values in particular polyploids are less than expected. The availability of the Angiosperm DNA C-values database (http:// www.rbgkew.org.uk/cvavhomepage.html) has allowed this question to be addressed across a broad range of angiosperms and has revealed striking results deviating from expectation: (i) mean 1C DNA amount did not increase in direct proportion with ploidy, and (ii) mean DNA amount per basic genome (calculated by dividing the 2C value by ploidy) tended to decrease with increasing ploidy. These results suggest that loss of DNA following polyploid formation, or genome downsizing, may be a widespread phenomenon of considerable biological significance. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular events that take place following polyploid formation together with new data on how DNA amounts can both increase and decrease provide some insights into how genome downsizing may take place.

Owen attempts to unsettle the implied antagonism between magic and moder nity in this rich contribution to modern British intellectual historiography. Indeed, The Place of Enchantment insists that fin de siecle occultism was a constitutive element—or at least symptomatic—of modern British culture (8). Owen offers a nuanced account of occultism from 1880 until 1914, in which she centralizes ritual magic and magicians in historical accounts of British modernity. She observes that late Victorian and Edwardian England’s “occult preoccupation” constituted “one of the most remarked trends” of the period, as many educated, middle-class white women and men “became absorbed by metaphysical quests, heterodox spiritual encounters, and occult experimentation” (4, 7). Marked interest in medieval and Renaissance Christian mysticism, “heterodox inspirational neo-Christianity,” and nondenominational and/or non-Christian esoteric philosophy characterized this new “spiritual movement of the age” (4). The Place of Enchantment addresses a scholarly lacuna and what Owens terms an “almost willful” scholarly amnesia regarding “the hugely popular occult movement of the turn of the century” (5).

Rathke as early as 1839 observed the continuity of the columella and hyoid arch in snakes. The comparative anatomy of the lacertilian columella auris has been exhaustively studied by Versluys ('03) and was shown by him to be composed of two morphologically distinct parts, a median segment, the stapes, closing the fenestra vestibuli, and a lateral segment, the extracolumella, which remains cartilaginous through life and whose outer end is attached to the tympanic membrane. The independence in origin of columella and otic capsule has not been recognized, however, by all investigators although at the present time the evidence is quite convincing that the columella auris is entirely extra-capsular in origin. In Lacertilia, according to Versluys, the extracolumella apparently takes part in the completion of the hyoid arch and in fact i t has been termed the hyostapes by Hoffman ('89) in contradistinction to the otostapes, which that investigator regarded as of labyrinthine origin. I n Testudo, according to Bender (,ll), the columella is united with the hyale by means of the interhyale and the extracolumella lies wholly external to the arch which is made up of the cornu hyale, interhyale, and columella.

Unfortunately, the “polyphyletic” origin identified for several reptilian orders, as well as difficulties in assuming that extant forms studied are representative of reptiles ancestral to mammals, renders attempts at evolutionary interpretation hazardous if one attempts to sustain the common practice of imposing a mammalian framework and nomenclature for identifying homologous structures. Although the principal role of comparative anatomy lies in the establishment of homologies on the basis of form and relations, modern investigations have extended beyond paleontological approaches and have begun to apply a variety of experimental methods in an effort to ascertain functional correlates.

Since that time contributions have been made to the knowledge of the region in the alligator (Huber and Crosby, '26), chameleon (Shanklin, '30, '33) , Lacerta (Frederikse, '31), turtles, (Papez, '35, '36), and various other reptiles (Huber and Crosby, '33 ; Kappers, Huber and Crosby, '36). Kuhlenbeck ('31) figured the nucleus posterodorsalis in the dorsal thalamus of Lacerta and turtles. There has, however, been much confusion in the identification of comparable structures in different animals. Recently a further structure was described by Papez in various forms which had not been clearly identified by other authors. In the comparative and descriptive anatomy of the brain, the posterior commissure has long been considered the boundary between the diencephalon and the mesencephalon. There exists some doubt, however, as to whether this commissure and its nuclei should be interpreted as diencephalic or mesencephalic structures.

The technologies rely on engineered endonucleases to generate double stranded breaks (DSBs) at target loci. The DSBs are repaired through the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways in cells, resulting in mutations and sequence replacement, respectively. In the widely used CRISPR/Cas9 system, the endonuclease Cas9 is targeted by a CRISPR small RNA to DNA sequence of interest. In this review, we describe the four available types of genome editing tools, ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cpf1, and show their applications in functional genomics research and precision molecular breeding of crops.",Biology,5,0,abstract genome editing technology powerful tool studying gene function crop improvement technology rely engineered endonuclease generate double stranded break dsbs target locus dsbs repaired errorprone nonhomologous end joining nhej homologydirected repair hdr pathway cell resulting mutation sequence replacement respectively widely used crisprcas system endonuclease ca targeted crispr small rna dna sequence interest review describe four available type genome editing tool zfn talen crisprcas crisprcpf show application functional genomics research precision molecular breeding crop

Bleaching can be the result of loss of the pigmented algae from the host or of loss of pigment from the algae. This article considers only the phenomenon of algal loss. Most attention has been directed to bleaching in scleractinian (hard) corals in the tropics (e.g., Brown 1990, Glynn 1990, Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1990). It is a subject of concern because of mortality and local extinctions associated with large-scale bleaching episodes (Glynn and de Weert 1991; but see Glynn and Feingold 1992), the widespread belief that bleaching episodes have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity within the past decade (D'Elia et al. 1991), and speculation about possible links to global warming (Glynn",Biology,4,0,leaching organism hard soft coral giant clam sea anemone loss pigment associated symbiotic algae zooxanthellae bleaching result loss pigmented algae host loss pigment algae article considers phenomenon algal loss attention directed bleaching scleractinian hard coral tropic eg brown glynn williams bunkleywilliams subject concern mortality local extinction associated largescale bleaching episode glynn de weert see glynn feingold widespread belief bleaching episode increased dramatically frequency intensity within past decade delia et al speculation possible link global warming glynn

Extinct Birds,"The lecturer observed that comparative anatomy showed that birds were more nearly allied to reptiles than to mammals, however striking the external differences between them might be. Hence the late Professor Huxley had included birds and reptiles in one common group—the Sauropsida. Evolutionists believed that birds had originated from reptiles, though it was not known from what order of reptiles they were descended. The resemblances between birds and the Pterodactyles, or winged reptiles of the Jurassic epoch, were merely adaptive, but some of the likewise extinct order of Dinosauria had certainly bird-like osteological peculiarities. It was, however, interesting to know that the oldest known fossil bird—the Archæopteryx of the Upper Jurassic—was more reptile-like than any later bird, inasmuch as it had teeth in its jaws, a less specialised anterior extremity, and the caudal part of the vertebral column was elongated and tapering. The Archæopteryx formed one of the three great divisions into which birds were classed by Huxley—namely, the Saururae, or lizard-tailed; the other two being the Ratitæ, or ostrich-like birds, and the Carinatae, which included the overwhelming majority of living species. The Ratitæ comprised the Ostrich, the Emu, &c, running birds with degenerate wings, and consequently incapable of flight. Remains referred to Ratitæ have been found in Tertiary strata, but the most complete were those from the more recent accumulations, such as the Æpiornis, or Giant Bird, of Madagascar, eggs of which have been found measuring 14 inches in length; and the huge Moas of New Zealand, some of",Biology,3,0,lecturer observed comparative anatomy showed bird nearly allied reptile mammal however striking external difference might hence late professor huxley included bird reptile one common groupthe sauropsida evolutionist believed bird originated reptile though known order reptile descended resemblance bird pterodactyles winged reptile jurassic epoch merely adaptive likewise extinct order dinosauria certainly birdlike osteological peculiarity however interesting know oldest known fossil birdthe archæopteryx upper jurassicwas reptilelike later bird inasmuch teeth jaw le specialised anterior extremity caudal part vertebral column elongated tapering archæopteryx formed one three great division bird classed huxleynamely saururae lizardtailed two ratitæ ostrichlike bird carinatae included overwhelming majority living specie ratitæ comprised ostrich emu c running bird degenerate wing consequently incapable flight remains referred ratitæ found tertiary stratum complete recent accumulation æpiornis giant bird madagascar egg found measuring inch length huge moa new zealand

We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First, proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation.",Biology,2,0,major pathway eukaryotic messenger rna mrna turnover begin deadenylation followed decapping exonucleolytic decay provide evidence mrna decapping degradation occur discrete cytoplasmic focus yeast call processing body p body first protein activate catalyze decapping concentrated p body second inhibiting mrna turnover decapping lead loss p body however inhibiting turnover decapping increase abundance size p body finally mrna degradation intermediate localized p body result define flux mrna polysomes p body critical aspect cytoplasmic mrna metabolism possible site regulation mrna degradation

Among reptiles, tail regeneration has been extensively studied in Lepidosauria, the subclass that includes lizards, but this study presents the first anatomical and histological evidence of tail regeneration in an archosaur, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). All animals were wild caught juveniles or sub‐adults with an average total body length of 133.4±29.2cm (n=3). Although the duration of tail regrowth is unknown, the average length of the regenerated tail was 15.7±7.3cm. The regenerated tail was externally distinct from the original tail. The scales were compacted and lacked organization as well as dorsal scutes. Gross dissection, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the caudal vertebrae were replaced by a ventrally‐positioned, unsegmented endoskeleton. This contrasts with lepidosaurs, where the regenerated tail is radially organized around a central endoskeleton, but shares commonality with urodele amphibians that regrow a tail with a clear dorsal‐ventral axis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that this alligator structure was composed of cartilage, which formed a hollow rod with foramina distributed along the proximal‐distal axis. Furthermore, in contrast to the original tail, the regenerated tail lacked skeletal muscle and instead featured adipose and fibrous connective tissue supplied by a dense network of newly established axons and blood vessels. Despite substantial regrowth of the tail, the deposition of extensive connective tissue is reminiscent of mammalian wound healing or fibrosis. Using Herovici’s stain, it was shown that the regenerated tail is composed of both type I and type III collagen fibers. The lack of muscle contrasts with the lepidosaurs, which regrow functional skeletal muscle groups, but shares similarities with regenerated limbs in Xenopus adult frogs, which have a cartilaginous endoskeleton surrounded by connective tissue, but lacking skeletal muscle. Overall, this study of regeneration in the alligator identifies a distinct pattern of regrowth with features in common with lepidosaurs, amphibia, and wound repair in mammals.

Bleaching can be the result of loss of the pigmented algae from the host or of loss of pigment from the algae. This article considers only the phenomenon of algal loss. Most attention has been directed to bleaching in scleractinian (hard) corals in the tropics (e.g., Brown 1990, Glynn 1990, Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1990). It is a subject of concern because of mortality and local extinctions associated with large-scale bleaching episodes (Glynn and de Weert 1991; but see Glynn and Feingold 1992), the widespread belief that bleaching episodes have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity within the past decade (D'Elia et al. 1991), and speculation about possible links to global warming (Glynn",Biology,4,0,leaching organism hard soft coral giant clam sea anemone loss pigment associated symbiotic algae zooxanthellae bleaching result loss pigmented algae host loss pigment algae article considers phenomenon algal loss attention directed bleaching scleractinian hard coral tropic eg brown glynn williams bunkleywilliams subject concern mortality local extinction associated largescale bleaching episode glynn de weert see glynn feingold widespread belief bleaching episode increased dramatically frequency intensity within past decade delia et al speculation possible link global warming glynn

Owen attempts to unsettle the implied antagonism between magic and moder nity in this rich contribution to modern British intellectual historiography. Indeed, The Place of Enchantment insists that fin de siecle occultism was a constitutive element—or at least symptomatic—of modern British culture (8). Owen offers a nuanced account of occultism from 1880 until 1914, in which she centralizes ritual magic and magicians in historical accounts of British modernity. She observes that late Victorian and Edwardian England’s “occult preoccupation” constituted “one of the most remarked trends” of the period, as many educated, middle-class white women and men “became absorbed by metaphysical quests, heterodox spiritual encounters, and occult experimentation” (4, 7). Marked interest in medieval and Renaissance Christian mysticism, “heterodox inspirational neo-Christianity,” and nondenominational and/or non-Christian esoteric philosophy characterized this new “spiritual movement of the age” (4). The Place of Enchantment addresses a scholarly lacuna and what Owens terms an “almost willful” scholarly amnesia regarding “the hugely popular occult movement of the turn of the century” (5).

A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

The most unusual finding was a complete columellar ossicle approximately 5 in. in length and 2‐4 mm in diameter. The footplate of the columella was still positioned in the round window nitch. Examination of the columella permitted estimation of the position of the position of the tympanic membrane. The petrified bone retained its fine morphology so well that thin sections of the columella show haversian canals as in fresh bone. The entire cochlea and semicircular canals were indentified. Anatomical determinations were made by natural fracturing, careful dissection by sand under air pressure, and by x‐ray tomography. The comparative functional anatomy of this 30 ft reptile will be made with some present day reptiles and birds.

Genes identified include the β myosin heavy chain gene (βMHC) on chromosome 14q1, the troponin T gene on chromosome 1q, and the α tropomyosin gene on chromosome 15q. In addition, a fourth locus is present on chromosome 11q11, but the gene remains to be identified. More than 35 missense mutations in the βMHC, 3 mutations in troponin T, and 2 mutations in α tropomyosin gene in HCM patients have been identified. Functional studies have shown that the mutant βMHC protein has impaired actomyosin interaction and that expression of the mutant myosin disrupts the assembly of sarcomere in feline cardiocytes. Genotype-phenotype correlations of βMHC mutations have shown that mutations such as Arg403Gln, Arg453Cys, and Arg719Trp are associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death and a significantly decreased life expectancy, whereas mutations Gly256Glu and Leu908Val have a near-normal life span.

Bleaching can be the result of loss of the pigmented algae from the host or of loss of pigment from the algae. This article considers only the phenomenon of algal loss. Most attention has been directed to bleaching in scleractinian (hard) corals in the tropics (e.g., Brown 1990, Glynn 1990, Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1990). It is a subject of concern because of mortality and local extinctions associated with large-scale bleaching episodes (Glynn and de Weert 1991; but see Glynn and Feingold 1992), the widespread belief that bleaching episodes have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity within the past decade (D'Elia et al. 1991), and speculation about possible links to global warming (Glynn",Biology,4,0,leaching organism hard soft coral giant clam sea anemone loss pigment associated symbiotic algae zooxanthellae bleaching result loss pigmented algae host loss pigment algae article considers phenomenon algal loss attention directed bleaching scleractinian hard coral tropic eg brown glynn williams bunkleywilliams subject concern mortality local extinction associated largescale bleaching episode glynn de weert see glynn feingold widespread belief bleaching episode increased dramatically frequency intensity within past decade delia et al speculation possible link global warming glynn

Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters.

A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

Additionally, activation of NF-κB in cancer cells by chemotherapy or by radiation can blunt the ability of the cancer therapy to induce cell death.

The technologies rely on engineered endonucleases to generate double stranded breaks (DSBs) at target loci. The DSBs are repaired through the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways in cells, resulting in mutations and sequence replacement, respectively. In the widely used CRISPR/Cas9 system, the endonuclease Cas9 is targeted by a CRISPR small RNA to DNA sequence of interest. In this review, we describe the four available types of genome editing tools, ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cpf1, and show their applications in functional genomics research and precision molecular breeding of crops.",Biology,5,0,abstract genome editing technology powerful tool studying gene function crop improvement technology rely engineered endonuclease generate double stranded break dsbs target locus dsbs repaired errorprone nonhomologous end joining nhej homologydirected repair hdr pathway cell resulting mutation sequence replacement respectively widely used crisprcas system endonuclease ca targeted crispr small rna dna sequence interest review describe four available type genome editing tool zfn talen crisprcas crisprcpf show application functional genomics research precision molecular breeding crop

A subclassification into nonsyndromic and syndromic cases would allow for uniform analysis. The limited data on anodontia and hyperdontia have made the genetic analysis of these anomalies difficult. The most suitable data for analysis on the genetics of numeric anomalies of dentition are on hypodontia. A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor

Owen attempts to unsettle the implied antagonism between magic and moder nity in this rich contribution to modern British intellectual historiography. Indeed, The Place of Enchantment insists that fin de siecle occultism was a constitutive element—or at least symptomatic—of modern British culture (8). Owen offers a nuanced account of occultism from 1880 until 1914, in which she centralizes ritual magic and magicians in historical accounts of British modernity. She observes that late Victorian and Edwardian England’s “occult preoccupation” constituted “one of the most remarked trends” of the period, as many educated, middle-class white women and men “became absorbed by metaphysical quests, heterodox spiritual encounters, and occult experimentation” (4, 7). Marked interest in medieval and Renaissance Christian mysticism, “heterodox inspirational neo-Christianity,” and nondenominational and/or non-Christian esoteric philosophy characterized this new “spiritual movement of the age” (4). The Place of Enchantment addresses a scholarly lacuna and what Owens terms an “almost willful” scholarly amnesia regarding “the hugely popular occult movement of the turn of the century” (5).

A reevaluation of this data, as presented in this report, suggests hypodontia follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, the fact that penetrance is not complete suggests the presence of a mechanism whereby epistatic genes interfere with the phenotypic expression of the hypodontia gene. How this occurs is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests a major single gene defect, which is modified by genetic or environmental factors.",Biology,4,0,suggested classification numeric anomaly teeth trimodal classification anodontia hypodontia hyperdontia subclassification nonsyndromic syndromic case would allow uniform analysis limited data anodontia hyperdontia made genetic analysis anomaly difficult suitable data analysis genetics numeric anomaly dentition hypodontia reevaluation data presented report suggests hypodontia follows autosomal dominant mode inheritance however fact penetrance complete suggests presence mechanism whereby epistatic gene interfere phenotypic expression hypodontia gene occurs uncertain available evidence suggests major single gene defect modified genetic environmental factor
375,166a3e0b9674b08567938eb7445f9ed94bef1d3c,Genome downsizing in polyploid plants,"All else being equal, polyploids are expected to have larger C-values (amount of DNA in the unreplicated gametic nucleus) than their diploid progenitors, increasing in direct proportion with ploidy. This expectation is observed in some polyploid series, especially those newly formed, but there are examples suggesting that C-values in particular polyploids are less than expected. The availability of the Angiosperm DNA C-values database (http:// www.rbgkew.org.uk/cvavhomepage.html) has allowed this question to be addressed across a broad range of angiosperms and has revealed striking results deviating from expectation: (i) mean 1C DNA amount did not increase in direct proportion with ploidy, and (ii) mean DNA amount per basic genome (calculated by dividing the 2C value by ploidy) tended to decrease with increasing ploidy. These results suggest that loss of DNA following polyploid formation, or genome downsizing, may be a widespread phenomenon of considerable biological significance. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular events that take place following polyploid formation together with new data on how DNA amounts can both increase and decrease provide some insights into how genome downsizing may take place.

Bleaching can be the result of loss of the pigmented algae from the host or of loss of pigment from the algae. This article considers only the phenomenon of algal loss. Most attention has been directed to bleaching in scleractinian (hard) corals in the tropics (e.g., Brown 1990, Glynn 1990, Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1990). It is a subject of concern because of mortality and local extinctions associated with large-scale bleaching episodes (Glynn and de Weert 1991; but see Glynn and Feingold 1992), the widespread belief that bleaching episodes have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity within the past decade (D'Elia et al. 1991), and speculation about possible links to global warming (Glynn",Biology,4,0,leaching organism hard soft coral giant clam sea anemone loss pigment associated symbiotic algae zooxanthellae bleaching result loss pigmented algae host loss pigment algae article considers phenomenon algal loss attention directed bleaching scleractinian hard coral tropic eg brown glynn williams bunkleywilliams subject concern mortality local extinction associated largescale bleaching episode glynn de weert see glynn feingold widespread belief bleaching episode increased dramatically frequency intensity within past decade delia et al speculation possible link global warming glynn

Terrestrial and celestial events are linked in great mythic creations that bind together the elements of a culture's archetypal consciousness. The ancient expression, “As it is above, so shall it be below,” characterizes this relationship between the celestial cycles and those of our more immediate human experience (Saul 1993 ). We see our world writ large in the heavens and tend to place our own face and stamp on everything in nature, including the creatures that share our environment. Particularly for nonliterate cultures, the images perceived in the constellations, as well as the planetary peregrinations among them, serve as an eternal mnemonic record for the recall of the vital oral traditions that maintain those cultures. These are among those universals derived from comparative studies of ancient and native celestial lore, religion, and worldview—what we call archaeoastronomy (see glossary)—and the presence of arthropods in astronomy is no exception.",Biology,3,0,people culture past present perceived important aspect earthly world mirrored heaven terrestrial celestial event linked great mythic creation bind together element culture archetypal consciousness ancient expression shall characterizes relationship celestial cycle immediate human experience saul see world writ large heaven tend place face stamp everything nature including creature share environment particularly nonliterate culture image perceived constellation well planetary peregrination among serve eternal mnemonic record recall vital oral tradition maintain culture among universal derived comparative study ancient native celestial lore religion worldviewwhat call archaeoastronomy see glossaryand presence arthropod astronomy exception

Unfortunately, the “polyphyletic” origin identified for several reptilian orders, as well as difficulties in assuming that extant forms studied are representative of reptiles ancestral to mammals, renders attempts at evolutionary interpretation hazardous if one attempts to sustain the common practice of imposing a mammalian framework and nomenclature for identifying homologous structures. Although the principal role of comparative anatomy lies in the establishment of homologies on the basis of form and relations, modern investigations have extended beyond paleontological approaches and have begun to apply a variety of experimental methods in an effort to ascertain functional correlates. Rather than attempt to recount previous efforts devoted to synthesizing the complex comparative anatomical literature,‘ it is the intent of this narrative to provide a commentary principally based upon experimental contributions in the past decade as a supplement to the admirable and extensive review by Goldby and Gamble2 and to identify some problems amenable to experimental investigation, with particular emphasis on some recent findings based on electron microscopy, neuronal degeneration, and electrophysiological analysis as they apply to the principal areas of current interest.",Biology,4,0,interest reptilian nervous system derives largely view reptile occupy intermediate phyletic position amphibian advanced warmblooded vertebrate including bird mammal unfortunately polyphyletic origin identified several reptilian order well difficulty assuming extant form studied representative reptile ancestral mammal render attempt evolutionary interpretation hazardous one attempt sustain common practice imposing mammalian framework nomenclature identifying homologous structure although principal role comparative anatomy lie establishment homology basis form relation modern investigation extended beyond paleontological approach begun apply variety experimental method effort ascertain functional correlate rather attempt recount previous effort devoted synthesizing complex comparative anatomical literature intent narrative provide commentary principally based upon experimental contribution past decade supplement admirable extensive review goldby gamble identify problem amenable experimental investigation particular emphasis recent finding based electron microscopy neuronal degeneration electrophysiological analysis apply principal area current interest

Unfortunately, the “polyphyletic” origin identified for several reptilian orders, as well as difficulties in assuming that extant forms studied are representative of reptiles ancestral to mammals, renders attempts at evolutionary interpretation hazardous if one attempts to sustain the common practice of imposing a mammalian framework and nomenclature for identifying homologous structures. Although the principal role of comparative anatomy lies in the establishment of homologies on the basis of form and relations, modern investigations have extended beyond paleontological approaches and have begun to apply a variety of experimental methods in an effort to ascertain functional correlates. Rather than attempt to recount previous efforts devoted to synthesizing the complex comparative anatomical literature,‘ it is the intent of this narrative to provide a commentary principally based upon experimental contributions in the past decade as a supplement to the admirable and extensive review by Goldby and Gamble2 and to identify some problems amenable to experimental investigation, with particular emphasis on some recent findings based on electron microscopy, neuronal degeneration, and electrophysiological analysis as they apply to the principal areas of current interest.",Biology,4,0,interest reptilian nervous system derives largely view reptile occupy intermediate phyletic position amphibian advanced warmblooded vertebrate including bird mammal unfortunately polyphyletic origin identified several reptilian order well difficulty assuming extant form studied representative reptile ancestral mammal render attempt evolutionary interpretation hazardous one attempt sustain common practice imposing mammalian framework nomenclature identifying homologous structure although principal role comparative anatomy lie establishment homology basis form relation modern investigation extended beyond paleontological approach begun apply variety experimental method effort ascertain functional correlate rather attempt recount previous effort devoted synthesizing complex comparative anatomical literature intent narrative provide commentary principally based upon experimental contribution past decade supplement admirable extensive review goldby gamble identify problem amenable experimental investigation particular emphasis recent finding based electron microscopy neuronal degeneration electrophysiological analysis apply principal area current interest

400,fd7415204fa3a142ccf7e158cd6ecfb90d350a98,Visualization of wormholes in sensor networks,"Several protocols have been proposed to defend against wormholes in ad hoc networks by adopting positioning devices, synchronized clocks, or directional antennas. In this paper, we propose a mechanism, MDS-VOW, to detect wormholes in a sensor network. MDS-VOW first reconstructs the layout of the sensors using multi-dimensional scaling. To compensate the distortions caused by distance measurement errors, a surface smoothing scheme is adopted. MDS-VOW then detects the wormhole by visualizing the anomalies introduced by the attack. The anomalies, which are caused by the fake connections through the wormhole, bend the reconstructed surface to pull the sensors that are faraway to each other. Through detecting the bending feature, the wormhole is located and the fake connections are identified. The contributions of MDS-VOW are: (1) it does not require the sensors to be equipped with special hardware, (2) it adopts and combines the techniques from social science, computer graphics, and scientific visualization to attack the problem in network security. We examine the accuracy of the proposed mechanism when the sensors are deployed in a circle area and one wormhole exists in the network. The results show that MDS-VOW has a low false alarm ratio when the distance measurement errors are not large.",Computer Science,4,0,several protocol proposed defend wormhole ad hoc network adopting positioning device synchronized clock directional antenna paper propose mechanism mdsvow detect wormhole sensor network mdsvow first reconstructs layout sensor using multidimensional scaling compensate distortion caused distance measurement error surface smoothing scheme adopted mdsvow detects wormhole visualizing anomaly introduced attack anomaly caused fake connection wormhole bend reconstructed surface pull sensor faraway detecting bending feature wormhole located fake connection identified contribution mdsvow require sensor equipped special hardware adopts combine technique social science computer graphic scientific visualization attack problem network security examine accuracy proposed mechanism sensor deployed circle area one wormhole exists network result show mdsvow low false alarm ratio distance measurement error large

These constraints are called constraints of difference. They are defined on a subset of variables by a set of tuples for which the values occuring in the same tuple are all different. In this paper, a new filtering algorithm for these constraints is presented. It achieves the generalized arc-consistency condition for these non-binary constraints. It is based on matching theory and its complexity is low. In fact, for a constraint defined on a subset of p variables having domains of cardinality at most d, its space complexity is O(pd) and its time complexity is O(p2d2). This filtering algorithm has been successfully used in the system RESYN (Vismara et al. 1992), to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem.",Computer Science,3,0,many reallife constraint satisfaction problem csps involve constraint similar alldifferent constraint constraint called constraint difference defined subset variable set tuples value occuring tuple different paper new filtering algorithm constraint presented achieves generalized arcconsistency condition nonbinary constraint based matching theory complexity low fact constraint defined subset p variable domain cardinality space complexity opd time complexity opd filtering algorithm successfully used system resyn vismara et al solve subgraph isomorphism problem

We introduce Astro, a system solving this problem efficiently in a decentralized, deterministic, and completely asynchronous manner. Astro builds on the insight that consensus is unnecessary to prevent double-spending. Instead of consensus, Astro relies on a weaker primitive---Byzantine reliable broadcast---enabling a simpler and more efficient implementation than consensus-based payment systems. In terms of efficiency, Astro executes a payment by merely broadcasting a message. The distinguishing feature of Astro is that it can maintain performance robustly, i.e., remain unaffected by a fraction of replicas being compromised or slowed down by an adversary. Our experiments on a public cloud network show that Astro can achieve near-linear scalability in a sharded setup, going from 10K payments/sec (2 shards) to 20K payments/sec (4 shards). In a nutshell, Astro can match VISA-level average payment throughput, and achieves a 5× improvement over a state-of-the-art consensus-based solution, while exhibiting sub-second 95^th percentile latency.",Computer Science,4,0,address problem online payment user transfer fund among introduce astro system solving problem efficiently decentralized deterministic completely asynchronous manner astro build insight consensus unnecessary prevent doublespending instead consensus astro relies weaker primitivebyzantine reliable broadcastenabling simpler efficient implementation consensusbased payment system term efficiency astro executes payment merely broadcasting message distinguishing feature astro maintain performance robustly ie remain unaffected fraction replica compromised slowed adversary experiment public cloud network show astro achieve nearlinear scalability sharded setup going k paymentssec shard k paymentssec shard nutshell astro match visalevel average payment throughput achieves improvement stateoftheart consensusbased solution exhibiting subsecond th percentile latency

However, neither IA nor IOMTS consider conjunction that is needed in practice when a component satisfies multiple interfaces, while Larsen's MTS-conjunction is not closed. In addition, IOMTS-parallel composition exhibits a compositionality defect. 
 
This paper defines conjunction on IA and MTS and proves the operators to be 'correct', i.e., the greatest lower bounds wrt. IA- and resp. MTS-refinement. As its main contribution, a novel interface theory called Modal Interface Automata (MIA) is introduced: MIA is a rich subset of IOMTS, is equipped with compositional parallel and conjunction operators, and allows a simpler embedding of IA than Nyman's.

In this context, several techniques have been proposed for auto-parallelization of programs. Recently, thread-level speculation (TLS) has been proposed as a means to parallelize difficult-to-analyze serial codes. In general, more than one technique can be employed for parallelizing a given program. The overlapping nature of the applicability of the various techniques makes it hard to assess the intrinsic performance potential of each. In this paper, we present a tight analysis of the (unique) performance potential of both: (a) TLS in general and (b) specific types of thread-level speculation, viz., control speculation, data dependence speculation and data value speculation, for the SPEC2 CPU2006 benchmark suite in light of the various limiting factors such as the threading overhead and misspeculation penalty. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of TLS based on SPEC CPU2006 and accounts for the aforementioned real-life con-straints.

Due to the presence of speckle, which can be modeled as a strong, multiplicative noise, edge detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is extremely difficult, and edge detectors developed for optical images are inefficient. Several robust operators have been developed for the detection of isolated step edges in speckled images. The authors propose a new step-edge detector for SAR images, which is optimal in the minimum mean square error (MSSE) sense under a stochastic multiedge model. It computes a normalized ratio of exponentially weighted averages (ROEWA) on opposite sides of the central pixel. This is done in the horizontal and vertical direction, and the magnitude of the two components yields an edge strength map. Thresholding of the edge strength map by a modified version of the watershed algorithm and region merging to eliminate false edges complete an efficient segmentation scheme.

Our dynamic compiler targets the increasingly popular ECMA‐335 specification. The goal of this project is twofold: on one hand, it aims at exploiting the parallelism exposed by multi‐core architectures to hide the dynamic compilation latencies by pipelining compilation and execution tasks; on the other hand, it provides a flexible, modular and adaptive framework for dynamic code optimization. The ILDJIT organization and the compiler design choices are presented and discussed highlighting how adaptability and extensibility can be achieved. Thanks to the compilation latency masking effect of the pipeline organization, our dynamic compiler is able to mask most of the compilation delay, when the underlying hardware exposes sufficient parallelism. Even when running on a single core, the ILDJIT adaptive optimization framework manages to speedup the computation with respect to other open‐source implementations of ECMA‐335.

In this paper, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses in Monero’s mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are vulnerable to “chain-reaction” analysis - that is, the real input can be deduced by elimination. Second, Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that they can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the “newest” input. We estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80% accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Next, we turn to the Monero ecosystem and study the importance of mining pools and the former anonymous marketplace AlphaBay on the transaction volume. We find that after removing mining pool activity, there remains a large amount of potentially privacy-sensitive transactions that are affected by these weaknesses. We propose and evaluate two countermeasures that can improve the privacy of future transactions.",Computer Science,5,0,abstract monero privacycentric cryptocurrency allows user obscure transaction including chaff coin called mixins along actual coin spend paper empirically evaluate two weakness moneros mixin sampling strategy first transaction input one mixins vulnerable chainreaction analysis real input deduced elimination second monero mixins sampled way easily distinguished real coin age distribution short real input usually newest input estimate heuristic used guess real input accuracy transaction mixins next turn monero ecosystem study importance mining pool former anonymous marketplace alphabay transaction volume find removing mining pool activity remains large amount potentially privacysensitive transaction affected weakness propose evaluate two countermeasure improve privacy future transaction

Analyzing this extra execution time is non-trivial because (i) bus arbitration protocols in such systems are often undocumented and (ii) the times when the memory bus is requested to be used are not explicitly controlled by the operating system scheduler; they are instead a result of cache misses. We present a method for finding an upper bound on the extra execution time of a task due to contention on the memory bus in COTS based multicore systems.

If a problem can theoretically be solved by computation, this does not mean that it is practical to do so. Conversely, if a problem is formally undecidable, this does not mean that the subcases of primary interest are impervious to solution by algorithmic methods. In the next section we describe such a class of programs, called “Loop programs.” Each Loop program consists only of assignment statements and iteration (loop) statements, the latter resembling the DO statement of FORTRAN, and special cases of the FOR and THROUGH statements of ALGOL and MAD.

In this paper, we present a distributed sequential auction scheme that takes the UAV limitations into account and provides a systematic procedure for the auction process. The task allocation scheme first validates the targets using neighbor's knowledge and then, depending on the decisions obtained from neighbors, an agent decides to auction or forfeit the target. The targets detected within a sensor range are validated and auctioned sequentially. A simulation study was conducted for different sensor and communication ranges to evaluate the performance of the sequential auction scheme which was compared with a greedy strategy and a simple distributed auction scheme. The results show that the sequential auction scheme performs better than the simple distributed auction and greedy strategy.",Computer Science,3,0,allocating task efficiently multiple uavs limited sensor communication range difficult problem paper present distributed sequential auction scheme take uav limitation account provides systematic procedure auction process task allocation scheme first validates target using neighbor knowledge depending decision obtained neighbor agent decides auction forfeit target target detected within sensor range validated auctioned sequentially simulation study conducted different sensor communication range evaluate performance sequential auction scheme compared greedy strategy simple distributed auction scheme result show sequential auction scheme performs better simple distributed auction greedy strategy

The memory network-on-chip is organized as a tree with time-division multiplexing (TDM) of accesses to the shared memory. The TDM based arbitration completely decouples processor cores and allows WCET analysis of the memory accesses on individual cores without considering the tasks on the other cores. Furthermore, we perform local, distributed arbitration according to the global TDM schedule.

In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which the phonological descriptions that are possible within the view of constraint interaction embodied in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) remain within the class of rational relations.

In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.",Computer Science,1,0,ray tracing ray casting form point sampling important technique computer graphic usefulness undermined aliasing artifact paper shown artifact inherent part point sampling consequence using regularly spaced sample sample occur appropriate nonuniformly spaced location frequency nyquist limit alias instead appear noise correct average intensity noise much le objectionable visual system aliasing ray tracing ray stochastically distributed perform monte carlo evaluation integral rendering equation called distributed ray tracing used simulate motion blur depth field penumbra gloss translucency

A box-pushing task is described as a sequence of sub-tasks with a separate controller designed for each step using finite state automata theory. Perceptual cues are formed by concatenating binary variables which represent locally sensed stimuli into boolean vectors used to specify transitions between sub-task steps. The approach is designed for a redundant set of homogeneous mobile robots equipped with simple sensors and stimulus-response behaviours.

One of the challenges has been the long confirmation time and low transaction throughput. Another challenge is the lack of incentives at certain steps of the protocol, raising concerns for transaction withholding, selfish mining, etc. To address these challenges, we propose Solidus, a decentralized cryptocurrency based on permissionless Byzantine consensus. A core technique in Solidus is to use proof of work for leader election to adapt the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocol to a permissionless setting. We also design Solidus to be incentive compatible and to mitigate selfish mining. Solidus improves on Bitcoin in confirmation time and provides safety and liveness assuming Byzantine players and the largest coalition of rational players collectively control less than one-third of the computation power.",Computer Science,4,0,decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin experienced great success also encountered many challenge one challenge long confirmation time low transaction throughput another challenge lack incentive certain step protocol raising concern transaction withholding selfish mining etc address challenge propose solidus decentralized cryptocurrency based permissionless byzantine consensus core technique solidus use proof work leader election adapt practical byzantine fault tolerance pbft protocol permissionless setting also design solidus incentive compatible mitigate selfish mining solidus improves bitcoin confirmation time provides safety liveness assuming byzantine player largest coalition rational player collectively control le onethird computation power

On these systems, users can write programs using a shared memory style of programming instead of message passing which is tedious and error prone. Our experience with one such system TreadMarks, has shown that a large class of applications does not perform well on these systems. TreadMarks is a software distributed shared memory system designed by Rice University researchers to run on networks of workstations and massively parallel computers. Due to the distributed nature of the memory system, shared memory synchronization primitives such as locks and barriers often cause significant amounts of communication. We have provided a set of powerful primitives that will alleviate the problems with locks and barriers on such systems. We have designed two sets of primitives the first set maintains coherence and is easy to use by a programmer, the second set does not maintain coherence and is best used by a compiler. These primitives require that the underlying DSM be enhanced. We have implemented some of our primitives on the TreadMarks DSM system and obtained reasonable performance improvements on application kernels from molecular dynamics and numerical analysis. Furthermore, we have identified key compiler optimizations that use the noncoherent primitives to reduce synchronization overhead and improve the performance of DSM systems.<<ETX>>",Computer Science,4,0,distributed shared memory dsm system provide illusion shared memory distributed memory system workstation network parallel computer cray td convex spp system user write program using shared memory style programming instead message passing tedious error prone experience one system treadmarks shown large class application perform well system treadmarks software distributed shared memory system designed rice university researcher run network workstation massively parallel computer due distributed nature memory system shared memory synchronization primitive lock barrier often cause significant amount communication provided set powerful primitive alleviate problem lock barrier system designed two set primitive first set maintains coherence easy use programmer second set maintain coherence best used compiler primitive require underlying dsm enhanced implemented primitive treadmarks dsm system obtained reasonable performance improvement application kernel molecular dynamic numerical analysis furthermore identified key compiler optimization use noncoherent primitive reduce synchronization overhead improve performance dsm systemsetx

We reveal shortcomings of current wallet UX as well as users’ misconceptions, some of which can be traced back to a reliance on their understanding of conventional payment systems. For example, some users believed that transactions were free, reversible, and could be canceled anytime, which is not the case in reality.

Usually, a roughness penalty is imposed on the solution. The difficulty is to avoid the smoothing of edges, which are very important attributes of the image. The authors first give sufficient conditions for the design of such an edge-preserving regularization. Under these conditions, it is possible to introduce an auxiliary variable whose role is twofold. Firstly, it marks the discontinuities and ensures their preservation from smoothing. Secondly, it makes the criterion half-quadratic. The optimization is then easier. The authors propose a deterministic strategy, based on alternate minimizations on the image and the auxiliary variable. This yields two algorithms, ARTUR and LEGEND. The authors apply these algorithms to the problem of SPECT reconstruction.<<ETX>>",Computer Science,0,0,many image processing problem illposed must regularized usually roughness penalty imposed solution difficulty avoid smoothing edge important attribute image author first give sufficient condition design edgepreserving regularization condition possible introduce auxiliary variable whose role twofold firstly mark discontinuity ensures preservation smoothing secondly make criterion halfquadratic optimization easier author propose deterministic strategy based alternate minimization image auxiliary variable yield two algorithm artur legend author apply algorithm problem spect reconstructionetx

This algorithm runs in (v) O(g) steps where v is the number of vertices of G. We believe that removing the nondiscrete topological definitions (i.e., the notation or differentiability, 2-dimensional surface, etc.) from our formal definitions has a multitude of advantages. First our goal is to produce an algorithm which operates on discrete machines and thus at some point we must remove these notions anyway. Secondly, demonstrations on proofs in the amalgam of graph theory and topology have been riddled with flaws (e.g., 4-color theorem, planarity algorithms, Jordan curve theorem), and which, no doubt, this paper also suffers. The hope is that a combinatorial proof may transcend these problems. Third, our main goal is not just to draw graphs on “inner tubes” but to understand how graph theory, topology and computational complexity interact.

So far, there is no formal correctness criterion for secure compilers that comes with a clear understanding of what security properties the criterion actually provides. Ideally, we would like a criterion that, if fulfilled by a compiler, guarantees that large classes of security properties of source language programs continue to hold in the compiled program, even as the compiled program is run against adversaries with low-level attack capabilities. This paper provides such a novel correctness criterion for secure compilers, called trace-preserving compilation (TPC). We show that TPC preserves a large class of security properties, namely all safety hyperproperties. Further, we show that TPC preserves more properties than full abstraction, the de-facto criterion used for secure compilation. Then, we show that several fully abstract compilers described in literature satisfy an additional, common property, which implies that they also satisfy TPC. As an illustration, we prove that a fully abstract compiler from a typed source language to an untyped target language satisfies TPC.",Computer Science,4,0,area secure compilation aim design compiler produce hardened code withstand attack lowlevel colinked component far formal correctness criterion secure compiler come clear understanding security property criterion actually provides ideally would like criterion fulfilled compiler guarantee large class security property source language program continue hold compiled program even compiled program run adversary lowlevel attack capability paper provides novel correctness criterion secure compiler called tracepreserving compilation tpc show tpc preserve large class security property namely safety hyperproperties show tpc preserve property full abstraction defacto criterion used secure compilation show several fully abstract compiler described literature satisfy additional common property implies also satisfy tpc illustration prove fully abstract compiler typed source language untyped target language satisfies tpc

Control information is sent over a dedicated signaling channel and data are sent over channels owned by the transmitters. Time is divided into slots on each channel and slots on the control channel are further split into mini-slots. Fixed time-division multiaccess (TDM) is used within each slot on the control channel. Transmitters indicate their intention to transmit a packet by transmitting the destination address during their appropriate mini-slot in the control channel and then transmit their packet in the next slot on their data channel. Receivers listen to the control channel and tune to the appropriate channel to receive packets addressed to them. A common but distributed arbitration algorithm is used to resolve conflicts when packets from many transmitters contend for the same receiver. Each receiver executes the same deterministic algorithm to choose one of the contending packets. Each transmitter uses the same algorithm to determine the success or failure of its packet. >,Computer Science,3,0,dynamic timewavelength division multiaccess protocol dtwdma proposed metropolitansized multichannel optical network employing fixed wavelength transmitter tunable optical receiver control information sent dedicated signaling channel data sent channel owned transmitter time divided slot channel slot control channel split minislots fixed timedivision multiaccess tdm used within slot control channel transmitter indicate intention transmit packet transmitting destination address appropriate minislot control channel transmit packet next slot data channel receiver listen control channel tune appropriate channel receive packet addressed common distributed arbitration algorithm used resolve conflict packet many transmitter contend receiver receiver executes deterministic algorithm choose one contending packet transmitter us algorithm determine success failure packet

The fog is not a substitute but a powerful complement to the cloud. It is worthy of studying the interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core (cloud). To address this issue, we study the tradeoff between power consumption and delay in a cloud-fog computing system. Specifically, we first mathematically formulate the workload allocation problem. After that, we develop an approximate solution to decompose the primal problem into three subproblems of corresponding subsystems, which can be independently solved. Finally, based on extensive simulations and numerical results, we show that by sacrificing modest computation resources to save communication bandwidth and reduce transmission latency, fog computing can significantly improve the performance of cloud computing.",Computer Science,5,0,fog computing characterized extending cloud computing edge network recently received considerable attention fog substitute powerful complement cloud worthy studying interplay cooperation edge fog core cloud address issue study tradeoff power consumption delay cloudfog computing system specifically first mathematically formulate workload allocation problem develop approximate solution decompose primal problem three subproblems corresponding subsystem independently solved finally based extensive simulation numerical result show sacrificing modest computation resource save communication bandwidth reduce transmission latency fog computing significantly improve performance cloud computing

 Auctions are promising decentralized methods for teams of agents to allocate and re-allocate tasks among themselves in dynamic, partially known and time-constrained domains with positive or negative synergies among tasks. Auction-based coordination systems are easy to understand, simple to implement and broadly applicable. They promise to be efficient both in communication (since agents communicate only essential summary information) and in computation (since agents compute their bids in parallel).

Especially, we focused on a color division method for generating neo-impressionist images. The French painter, George Seurat, introduced pointillism under the theory that the individual pigments of colors on the canvas are reconstructed on the human retina. Pointillism is a painting technique in which many small brush strokes are combined to form a picture and determines the color of brush strokes based on the optical mixing of juxtaposed colors.
 In order to express countless separate dots, we form hierarchical points using Wang Tiles contained points. Also palette will be constructed using neo-impressionist colors. Based on this palette, we propose color division algorithm that distributes hierarchical point's color to pointillist colors using probability function. Finally, hierarchical points set that applied proposed color division rule is converted into brush strokes that possesses properties such as shape and direction. This rendering algorithm is performed in our proposed system. Our scheme is able to produce a painting with artistic style and be applied to the various platform having the different computing performance and display resolution. This system also can be extended to various imaging devices (IPTV, camera, smart phone, digital photo frame and so on).",Computer Science,5,0,article propose rendering framework paintinglike image generation general system architecture mobile device especially focused color division method generating neoimpressionist image french painter george seurat introduced pointillism theory individual pigment color canvas reconstructed human retina pointillism painting technique many small brush stroke combined form picture determines color brush stroke based optical mixing juxtaposed color order express countless separate dot form hierarchical point using wang tile contained point also palette constructed using neoimpressionist color based palette propose color division algorithm distributes hierarchical point color pointillist color using probability function finally hierarchical point set applied proposed color division rule converted brush stroke posse property shape direction rendering algorithm performed proposed system scheme able produce painting artistic style applied various platform different computing performance display resolution system also extended various imaging device iptv camera smart phone digital photo frame

Gambit is easily ported, while retaining its high performance, through the use of a simple virtual machine (PVM). PVM allows a wide variety of machine-independent optimizations and it supports parallel computation based on the future construct. PVM conveys high-level information bidirectionally between the machine-independent front end of the compiler and the machine-dependent back end, making it easy to implement a number of common back end optimizations that are difficult to achieve for other virtual machines.
PVM is similar to many real computer architectures and has an option to efficiently gather dynamic measurements of virtual machine usage.

Load speculation techniques have been proposed to reduce this latency. Dependence Prediction can be used to allow loads to be issued before all prior store addresses are known, and to predict exactly which store a load should wait upon. Address Prediction can be used to allow a load to bypass the calculation of its effective address and speculatively issue. Value Prediction can be used to bypass the load forward latency and avoid cache misses. Memory renaming has been proposed to communicate stored values directly to aliased loads. In this paper we examine in detail the interaction and performance tradeoffs of these four load speculation techniques in the presence of two miss-speculation recovery architectures-reexecution and squash. We examine the performance of combining these techniques to create a load speculation chooser which provides performance improvement over using any one technique in isolation. We also examine the accuracy of these load speculation techniques for predicting data cache misses.",Computer Science,4,0,load latency remains significant bottleneck dynamically scheduled pipelined processor load speculation technique proposed reduce latency dependence prediction used allow load issued prior store address known predict exactly store load wait upon address prediction used allow load bypass calculation effective address speculatively issue value prediction used bypass load forward latency avoid cache miss memory renaming proposed communicate stored value directly aliased load paper examine detail interaction performance tradeoff four load speculation technique presence two missspeculation recovery architecturesreexecution squash examine performance combining technique create load speculation chooser provides performance improvement using one technique isolation also examine accuracy load speculation technique predicting data cache miss

Moreover, in view of emerging mobile collaborative application, the offloaded tasks can be duplicated when multiple users are in the same proximity. This motivates us to design a collaborative offloading scheme and cache the popular computation results that are likely to be reused by other mobile users. In this paper, we consider the scenario where multiple mobile users offload duplicated computation tasks to the network edge, and share the computation results among them. Our goal is to develop the optimal fine-grained collaborative offloading strategies with caching enhancements to minimize the overall execution delay at the mobile terminal side. To this end, we propose an optimal offloading with caching-enhancement scheme (OOCS) for femto-cloud scenario and mobile edge computing scenario, respectively. Simulation results show that compared to six alternative solutions in literature, our single-user OOCS can reduce execution delay up to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$42.83$</tex-math> </inline-formula>% and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$33.28$</tex-math></inline-formula>% for single-user femto-cloud and single-user mobile edge computing, respectively.

The analysis was performed by compiling a version of TCP and counting the number of the instructions in the common path. The analysis suggests that fewer than 200 instructions are required to process a TCP packet in the normal case. This number is small enough to support very high-speed transmission if it were the major overhead. The authors offer some speculations about the actual source of processing overhead in network protocols.<<ETX>>,Computer Science,3,0,author report preliminary analysis processing overhead transport protocol tcp transmission control protocol estimate possible performance range protocol analysis performed compiling version tcp counting number instruction common path analysis suggests fewer instruction required process tcp packet normal case number small enough support highspeed transmission major overhead author offer speculation actual source processing overhead network protocolsetx

We make use of appropriate variants of competitive analysis of algorithms in designing and analyzing our mechanisms. Thus, we do not require any probabilistic assumptions on bids.We present two new concepts regarding auctions, that of a cancellable auction and that of a generalized auction. We use cancellable auctions in the design of generalized auctions, but they are of independent interest as well. Cancellable auctions have the property that if the revenue collected does not meet certain predetermined criteria, then the auction can be cancelled and the resulting auction is still truthful. The trivial approach (run a truthful auction and cancel if needed) yields an auction that is not necessarily truthfu.Generalized auctions can be used to model many problems previously considered in the literature, as well as numerous new problems.

The volume can be broken up in a structured or unstructured manner, and the problem can be static or unsteady in time. Because the data are volumetric and all the information can be changing, traditional CAD techniques are not appropriate. Therefore, VISUAL3 was developed using intermediate mode-rendering methods. A unique aspect of VISUAL3 is the dimensional windowing approach coupled with cursor mapping, which allows efficient pointing in 3D space. VISUAL3 is composed of a large number of visualization tools that can be generally classified into identification, scanning, and probing techniques.<<ETX>>",Computer Science,5,0,visual highly interactive environment visualization volumetric scientific data described volume broken structured unstructured manner problem static unsteady time data volumetric information changing traditional cad technique appropriate therefore visual developed using intermediate moderendering method unique aspect visual dimensional windowing approach coupled cursor mapping allows efficient pointing space visual composed large number visualization tool generally classified identification scanning probing techniquesetx

Calyx combines a hardware-like structural language with a software-like control flow representation with loops and conditionals. This split representation enables a new class of hardware-focused optimizations that require both structural and control flow information which are crucial for high-level programming models for hardware design. The Calyx compiler lowers control flow constructs using finite-state machines and generates synthesizable hardware descriptions. We have implemented Calyx in an optimizing compiler that translates high-level programs to hardware. We demonstrate Calyx using two DSL-to-RTL compilers, a systolic array generator and one for a recent imperative accelerator language, and compare them to equivalent designs generated using high-level synthesis (HLS).

The environment applies the notion of split-level programming to relieve system engineers of software engineering concerns and to let them focus on system architecture. The script language is a Component Integration Language (CIL) because it implements a component model with introspection and loose typing capabilities. Component wrappers use split-level interfaces that implement the composition rules, dynamic type determination and type inference algorithms. Using an interface description language compiler automatically generates the split-level interfaces.

The core of the theory is the notion of HDS resolution which is based on a coding of any HDS into a dynamic graph which consists of a skew product of a polynomial dynamical system on the finite field of integers modulo 3 (to describe the transitions of the underlying automation) and directed graphs (to describe how data dependencies dynamically evolve).

Existing repurposed JIT compilers (RJIT compilers), however, have not yet delivered the hoped-for performance boosts. The performance of JVM languages, for instance, often lags behind standard interpreter implementations. Even more customized solutions that extend the internals of a JIT compiler for the target language compete poorly with those designed specifically for dynamically typed languages. Our own Fiorano JIT compiler is an example of this problem. As a state-of-the-art, RJIT compiler for Python, the Fiorano JIT compiler outperforms two other RJIT compilers (Unladen Swallow and Jython), but still shows a noticeable performance gap compared to PyPy, today's best performing Python JIT compiler. In this paper, we discuss techniques that have proved effective in the Fiorano JIT compiler as well as limitations of our current implementation. More importantly, this work offers the first in-depth look at benefits and limitations of the repurposed JIT compiler approach. We believe the most common pitfall of existing RJIT compilers is not focusing sufficiently on specialization, an abundant optimization opportunity unique to dynamically typed languages. Unfortunately, the lack of specialization cannot be overcome by applying traditional optimizations.",Computer Science,4,0,whenever need compile new dynamically typed language arises appealing option repurpose existing statically typed language justintime jit compiler repurposed jit compiler existing repurposed jit compiler rjit compiler however yet delivered hopedfor performance boost performance jvm language instance often lag behind standard interpreter implementation even customized solution extend internals jit compiler target language compete poorly designed specifically dynamically typed language fiorano jit compiler example problem stateoftheart rjit compiler python fiorano jit compiler outperforms two rjit compiler unladen swallow jython still show noticeable performance gap compared pypy today best performing python jit compiler paper discus technique proved effective fiorano jit compiler well limitation current implementation importantly work offer first indepth look benefit limitation repurposed jit compiler approach believe common pitfall existing rjit compiler focusing sufficiently specialization abundant optimization opportunity unique dynamically typed language unfortunately lack specialization overcome applying traditional optimization

This paper presents the design and implementation of transactional memory constructs in an unmanaged language. Unmanaged languages pose a unique set of challenges to transactional memory constructs - for example, lack of type and memory safety, use of function pointers, aliasing of local variables, and others. This paper describes novel compiler and runtime mechanisms that address these challenges and optimize the performance of transactions in an unmanaged environment. We have implemented these mechanisms in a production-quality C compiler and a high-performance software transactional memory runtime. We measure the effectiveness of these optimizations and compare the performance of lock-based versus transaction-based programming on a set of concurrent data structures and the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. On a 16 processor SMP system, the transaction-based version of the SPLASH-2 benchmarks scales much better than the coarse-grain locking version and performs comparably to the fine-grain locking version. Compiler optimizations significantly reduce the overheads of transactional memory so that, on a single thread, the transaction-based version incurs only about 6.4% overhead compared to the lock-based version for the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite.

The framework is based on the idea of the Nash bargaining solution from cooperative game theory, which not only provides the rate settings of users that are Pareto optimal from the point of view of the whole system, but are also consistent with the fairness axioms of game theory. We first consider the centralized problem and then show that this procedure can be decentralized so that greedy optimization by users yields the system optimal bandwidth allocations. We propose a distributed algorithm for implementing the optimal and fair bandwidth allocation and provide conditions for its convergence. The paper concludes with the pricing of elastic connections based on users' bandwidth requirements and users' budget. We show that the above bargaining framework can be used to characterize a rate allocation and a pricing policy which takes into account users' budget in a fair way and such that the total network revenue is maximized.",Computer Science,4,0,paper present game theoretic framework bandwidth allocation elastic service highspeed network framework based idea nash bargaining solution cooperative game theory provides rate setting user pareto optimal point view whole system also consistent fairness axiom game theory first consider centralized problem show procedure decentralized greedy optimization user yield system optimal bandwidth allocation propose distributed algorithm implementing optimal fair bandwidth allocation provide condition convergence paper concludes pricing elastic connection based user bandwidth requirement user budget show bargaining framework used characterize rate allocation pricing policy take account user budget fair way total network revenue maximized

The Logic of Decision (Jeffrey 1983) provides the correct framework for correlated evolutionary game theory and a variant of ""ratifiability"" is the appropriate generalization of ""evolutionarily stable strategy"". The resulting theory unifies the treatment of correlation due to kin, population viscosity, detection, signaling, reciprocal altruism, and behavior-dependent contexts.

598,812222e1b2e46d18c38576a8b19882bce57aa744,The design and implementation of a certifying compiler,"This paper presents the design and implementation of a compiler that translates programs written in a type-safe subset of the C programming language into highly optimized DEC Alpha assembly language programs, and a certifier that automatically checks the type safety and memory safety of any assembly language program produced by the compiler. The result of the certifier is either a formal proof of type safety or a counterexample pointing to a potential violation of the type system by the target program. The ensemble of the compiler and the certifier is called a certifying compiler.Several advantages of certifying compilation over previous approaches can be claimed. The notion of a certifying compiler is significantly easier to employ than a formal compiler verification, in part because it is generally easier to verify the correctness of the result of a computation than to prove the correctness of the computation itself. Also, the approach can be applied even to highly optimizing compilers, as demonstrated by the fact that our compiler generates target code, for a range of realistic C programs, which is competitive with both the cc and gcc compilers with all optimizations enabled. The certifier also drastically improves the effectiveness of compiler testing because, for each test case, it statically signals compilation errors that might otherwise require many executions to detect. Finally, this approach is a practical way to produce the safety proofs for a Proof-Carrying Code system, and thus may be useful in a system for safe mobile code.",Computer Science,3,0,paper present design implementation compiler translates program written typesafe subset c programming language highly optimized dec alpha assembly language program certifier automatically check type safety memory safety assembly language program produced compiler result certifier either formal proof type safety counterexample pointing potential violation type system target program ensemble compiler certifier called certifying compilerseveral advantage certifying compilation previous approach claimed notion certifying compiler significantly easier employ formal compiler verification part generally easier verify correctness result computation prove correctness computation also approach applied even highly optimizing compiler demonstrated fact compiler generates target code range realistic c program competitive cc gcc compiler optimization enabled certifier also drastically improves effectiveness compiler testing test case statically signal compilation error might otherwise require many execution detect finally approach practical way produce safety proof proofcarrying code system thus may useful system safe mobile code

In the proxy auction (revelation game) versions, the outcome is a point in the core of the exchange economy for the reported preferences.

Whenever this is forgotten, as happens in the so-called neoclassical synthesis, not only the original Keynesian spirit goes lost but also, and especially, we lose substantive bricks for our theoretical constructions. The paper considers an important instance of this general rule; namely Keynes's views on the logic of probability, meant as the field concerning human behaviour in an uncertain world (hence connected to, but distinct from, the pure theory of probability, meant as a field of mathematics). The paper begins by recalling the main aspects of the classical and frequentist approaches to probability and the main criticisms they received, pertaining among other things to the limits of their applicability. We then consider Keynes's own views, stressing three aspects: the definition of probability as pertaining to the field of logic, the notion of uncertainty and of the ‘weight of the argument’, the ‘theory of groups’. We then discuss the subjective approach of de Finetti, Ramsey and Savage, and contrast it with Keynes's own views. Finally, we consider the implications of our analysis for the interpretation of Keynes's General Theory, and of his attitude towards econometrics.",Economics,4,0,abstract interpreter agree keynes wideranging complex vision world underlies theoretical contribution whenever forgotten happens socalled neoclassical synthesis original keynesian spirit go lost also especially lose substantive brick theoretical construction paper considers important instance general rule namely keynes view logic probability meant field concerning human behaviour uncertain world hence connected distinct pure theory probability meant field mathematics paper begin recalling main aspect classical frequentist approach probability main criticism received pertaining among thing limit applicability consider keynes view stressing three aspect definition probability pertaining field logic notion uncertainty weight argument theory group discus subjective approach de finetti ramsey savage contrast keynes view finally consider implication analysis interpretation keynes general theory attitude towards econometrics

And, when is it reasonable to assume that behavior is part of a Nash equilibrium (and if it is reasonable, which equilibrium)? The traditional answers are not compelling, and much of evolutionary modeling is motivated by the need for a better answer.

The language, concepts and techniques of noncooperative game theory have become central to the discipline. This book provides the reader with some basic concepts from noncooperative theory, and then goes on to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and future of the theory as a tool of economic modelling and analysis. The central theses are that noncooperative game theory has been a remarkably popular tool in economics over the past decade because it allows analysts to capture essential features of dynamic competition and competition where some parties have proprietary information. The theory is weakest in providing a sense of when it - and equilibrium analysis in particular - can be applied and what to do when equilibrium analysis is inappropriate. Many of these weaknesses can be addressed by the consideration of individuals who are boundedly rational and learn imperfectly from the past. Written in a non-technical style and working by analogy, the book, first given as part of the Clarendon Lectures in Economics, is readily accessible to a broad audience and will be of interest to economists and students alike.

We find that equilibrium bidding is more aggressive than standard predictions. Indeed, in second-price auctions it is optimal to bid above one's valuation; that is, bidding ""frenzies"" can arise in equilibrium. Further, revenue equivalence between second-price and first-price auctions breaks down, with second-price outperforming first-price. We also find that strategic equivalence between second-price and English auctions no longer holds, although they remain revenue equivalent. We conclude that spiteful bidding rationalizes anomalies observed in laboratory experiments across the four auction forms better than the leading alternatives.",Economics,3,0,abstract study auction bidder independent private value attach disutility surplus rival derive symmetric equilibrium firstprice secondprice english dutch auction find equilibrium bidding aggressive standard prediction indeed secondprice auction optimal bid one valuation bidding frenzy arise equilibrium revenue equivalence secondprice firstprice auction break secondprice outperforming firstprice also find strategic equivalence secondprice english auction longer hold although remain revenue equivalent conclude spiteful bidding rationalizes anomaly observed laboratory experiment across four auction form better leading alternative

To the extent that cryptocurrencies are not issued by a centralized authority and do not rely on an official legal tender status for their acceptance, they may indeed appear as a dramatic departure from the historical trend that has led, over the past few centuries, to the making of national money and as a decisive step toward the “denationalization of money” advocated by F. A. von Hayek.

This theme issue includes three papers from leading regional scientists to appraise the status of spatial econometrics.

In the short term, however, anecdotal evidence indicates that gentrification actually increases crime, perhaps due to the relative difference in status between newcomers and existing residents, and to increased opportunities for criminal behavior. Further, consumers’ choice of residential location depends on crime rates, creating simultaneity that likely biases estimates that overlook this concern. I exploit the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles and subsequent short-term government-sponsored home financing incentives as an instrument to control for this endogeneity. The exogenous event induced middle- and upper-income individuals to purchase homes in earthquake-affected low and moderate-income neighborhoods, which I argue is independent of the influence of crime. The results show that in the short term, gentrification increases assaults, robberies, automobile thefts, and thefts from automobiles.",Economics,4,0,abstract theory suggests long term gentrificationwhich define phenomenon wealthier individual move lowerincome areasshould decrease neighborhood crime short term however anecdotal evidence indicates gentrification actually increase crime perhaps due relative difference status newcomer existing resident increased opportunity criminal behavior consumer choice residential location depends crime rate creating simultaneity likely bias estimate overlook concern exploit northridge earthquake los angeles subsequent shortterm governmentsponsored home financing incentive instrument control endogeneity exogenous event induced middle upperincome individual purchase home earthquakeaffected low moderateincome neighborhood argue independent influence crime result show short term gentrification increase assault robbery automobile theft theft automobile

Nevertheless, the problem has proved to be a frustrating one for economists. The obvious reason for the difficulty is the uncertainty that characterizes the problem. The specific uncertainty revolves around the interrelationship of the two firms and the fact that the decisions of one of them affect the other. Solutions have consisted of finding plausible (or implausible) behavioral assumptions that effectively eliminate the uncertainty. Economists have developed duopoly and oligopoly theory through the years by making different assumptions which produce models explaining some regularity believed to exist in duopoly or oligopoly markets (Bishop 1960).",Economics,4,0,duopoly theory long history economics distinguished list name associated history cournot frisch stackelberg nevertheless problem proved frustrating one economist obvious reason difficulty uncertainty characterizes problem specific uncertainty revolves around interrelationship two firm fact decision one affect solution consisted finding plausible implausible behavioral assumption effectively eliminate uncertainty economist developed duopoly oligopoly theory year making different assumption produce model explaining regularity believed exist duopoly oligopoly market bishop

Buyer i's preferences are characterized by an N-dimensional vector t^i = (t1^i, t2^i,..,tN^i). The coordinate ti^i can be interpreted as the usual ""private value"" of player i, while each other coordinate tj^i represents i's total payoff should j get the object. In this framework, we characterize incentive-compatible and individually-rational mechanisms, and look at second price auctions (which, under some conditions, maximize the seller's revenue). Any incentive combatible mechanism induces a conditional probability assignement vector field which is conservative. A useful geometric property of conservative vector fields is used for the derivation of a differential equation which determines equilibrium bids.

Due to its importance in applications some prominence is given to the first-price all-pay auction, for which a detailed characterization of equilibrium and an approximation to equilibrium of its well-studied complete information version are supplied. Furthermore, we relate our uniqueness result to the well-known multiplicity of equilibria in the “war of attrition” (second-price all-pay auction), which emerges as a “limit” point of the class of two-player auction games considered.Journalof Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: D44, C62, C72.",Economics,5,0,abstract prove existence uniqueness bayesian equilibrium class generally asymmetric allpay auction incomplete information due importance application prominence given firstprice allpay auction detailed characterization equilibrium approximation equilibrium wellstudied complete information version supplied furthermore relate uniqueness result wellknown multiplicity equilibrium war attrition secondprice allpay auction emerges limit point class twoplayer auction game consideredjournalof economic literatureclassification number c c

In the first model bidders have a binary distribution over their valuations for each object, in which case the optimal auction is efficient. The optimal auction takes one of two formats: either objects are sold in independent auctions, or a degree of bundling is introduced in the sense that the probability a bidder wins one object is increasing in her value for the other. The format of the optimal auction may depend upon the number of bidders. In the second model the restriction to binary distributions is relaxed, and the optimal auction is then inefficient.",Economics,5,0,paper analysis optimal auction several object first model bidder binary distribution valuation object case optimal auction efficient optimal auction take one two format either object sold independent auction degree bundling introduced sense probability bidder win one object increasing value format optimal auction may depend upon number bidder second model restriction binary distribution relaxed optimal auction inefficient

We present a game-theoretic model in which sensitivity to esteem varies across players and may depend on context as well players' beliefs about their opponents. For example, the pride associated with a generous image is greater when the player holding the image is in fact generous and believes the observers to be generous as well. The model can account both for the fact that players' behaviour sometimes depends on the opponents' unchosen options and for the prevalence of small symbolic gifts. Perhaps most importantly, the model offers an explanation for motivational crowding out: Control systems and pecuniary incentives may erode morale by signalling to the agent that the principal is not worth impressing.",Economics,5,0,many people sensitive social esteem pride source prosocial behavior present gametheoretic model sensitivity esteem varies across player may depend context well player belief opponent example pride associated generous image greater player holding image fact generous belief observer generous well model account fact player behaviour sometimes depends opponent unchosen option prevalence small symbolic gift perhaps importantly model offer explanation motivational crowding control system pecuniary incentive may erode morale signalling agent principal worth impressing

Manufacturers producing differentiated brands can choose to distribute through exclusive retail dealerships or nonexclusive dealerships. With nonexclusive dealing, manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although exclusive dealing eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive dealing is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt exclusive dealing. Moreover, even if adoption of exclusive dealing by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing.",Economics,5,0,consider incentive oligopolistic manufacturer adopt exclusive dealing manufacturer producing differentiated brand choose distribute exclusive retail dealership nonexclusive dealership nonexclusive dealing manufacturer face interbrand externality brandenhancing investment made one manufacturer may benefit brand manufacturer although exclusive dealing eliminates externality oligopolistic manufacturer may choose exclusive dealing exclusive dealing enhances incentive invest promotional investment form competition manufacturer thus manufacturer might earn higher profit nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investment find case nonexclusive dealing dominant strategy also find case manufacturer adopt exclusive dealing moreover even adoption exclusive dealing manufacturer equilibrium arise prisoner dilemma manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing

In these equilibria, jump bids serve as correlating devices which select asymmetric bidding functions to be played subsequently. Each possibility of jump bidding provides a Pareto improvement for the bidders from the symmetric equilibrium of a sealed bid, second-price auction. The expanded set of equilibria can approximate either first- or second-price outcomes and produce exactly the set of expected prices between those two bounds.

790,b2c6d048d93b8260df6ff6d72065c30050102152,A Simple Approach to Setting Reasonable Royalties for Standard-Essential Patents,"Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) typically require their members to license any standard-essential patent on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Unfortunately, numerous high-stakes disputes have recently broken out over just what these “FRAND commitments” mean and how and where to enforce them. We propose a simple, practical set of rules regarding patents that SSOs can adopt to achieve the goals of FRAND commitments far more efficiently with far less litigation. Under our proposed approach, if an standard-essential patent owner and an implementer of the standard cannot agree on licensing terms, the standard-essential patent owner is obligated to enter into binding baseball-style (or “final offer”) arbitration with any willing licensee to determine the royalty rate. This obligation may be conditioned on the implementer making a reciprocal FRAND Commitment for any standard-essential patents it owns that read on the same standard.

The automata theoretic approach is convenient for the solution of algorithmic problems (like the emptiness problem). The second contribution of this paper is a new subclass of the rational tree relations, called separate-rational tree relations, defined via a natural restriction on asynchronous tree automata. These relations are closed under composition, preserve regular tree languages, and generate precisely the regular sets in the unary case (all these properties fail for the general model), and they are still more powerful than, for instance, the automatic tree relations.",Mathematics,3,0,investigate rational relation tree starting point definition rational tree relation via rational expression raoult bull belgmath soc develop new class automaton called asynchronous tree automaton recognize exactly relation automaton theoretic approach convenient solution algorithmic problem like emptiness problem second contribution paper new subclass rational tree relation called separaterational tree relation defined via natural restriction asynchronous tree automaton relation closed composition preserve regular tree language generate precisely regular set unary case property fail general model still powerful instance automatic tree relation

The two parameters affecting this feature (whether it is active and whether + and − values may cooccur) also affect the two features that generate nonapproximative numbers. All three features are shown to be derivative of concepts in the literature on aspect and telicity, to have a straightforwardly compositional semantics, and to eschew ad hoc stipulations on cooccurrence (such as geometries and filters). Thus, what is proposed is a general theory of number, free of extrinsic stipulations. Empirically, the theory yields a characterization of all numbers attested crosslinguistically, a combinatorial explanation of Greenberg-style implications affecting their cooccurrence, a natural account of morphological compositionality, and insight into their diachronic sources and trajectories.",Mathematics,1,0,approximative number like paucal greater plural characterized term feature additive concerned additive closure two parameter affecting feature whether active whether value may cooccur also affect two feature generate nonapproximative number three feature shown derivative concept literature aspect telicity straightforwardly compositional semantics eschew ad hoc stipulation cooccurrence geometry filter thus proposed general theory number free extrinsic stipulation empirically theory yield characterization number attested crosslinguistically combinatorial explanation greenbergstyle implication affecting cooccurrence natural account morphological compositionality insight diachronic source trajectory

814,9b2ea92d8dd18969b1e9270b2c73737ff61eb820,The Multiple Realization Book,"On this point, Brooke provides some evidence that Gould himself (in his dispute with Simon Conway-Morris about the directedness of evolution) did not follow his own principle and did not expect other scientists to follow it. Ward shows how different concepts of the divine relate to differing concepts of natural order in a breathtaking overview encompassing several millennia of human thought, from early polytheism to the present day (in just 15 pages!). He argues that the dappled world view sits comfortably with ‘open theology’ and its non-deterministic relation between God and the world. I am less optimistic than Ward about the prospects of open theology and consider that traditional Christian theism holds sufficient resources to avoid reducing God to the ‘changeless actualization of every possibility’, ‘a static perfection which cannot do anything other than it does’ (217). In the final chapter of the book, Russell ReManning argues that natural order as piecemeal, local and open to different forms of causal influence provides a good starting-point for a renewed natural theology. ‘The kind of localized messy order might well be precisely the kind of order that would characterize a divinely designed natural order’ (232), where God stays intimately engaged with creation. Who should read Rethinking Order? I recommend the book to anybody interested in the concept of order in the natural sciences and its philosophical and theological implications. Practically, all contributors have expressed their views elsewhere at monograph length. Someone who had already read all their monographs might not find too many new insights here. But for the ordinary reader, who has had exposure to only some of the authors (as in my case) or even none, the volume provides an excellent overview that highlights the potential of this alternative view of natural order and that helps one think about possible remaining riddles.

Since many algebraic geometry notions such as singularities, birational maps, cycles, homology, intersection theory, and Riemann-Roch translate into simple facts about polytopes, toric varieties provide a marvelous source of examples in algebraic geometry. In the other direction, general facts from algebraic geometry have implications for such polytopes, such as to the problem of the number of lattice points they contain. In spite of the fact that toric varieties are very special in the spectrum of all algebraic varieties, they provide a remarkably useful testing ground for general theories.The aim of this mini-course is to develop the foundations of the study of toric varieties, with examples, and describe some of these relations and applications. The text concludes with Stanley's theorem characterizing the numbers of simplicies in each dimension in a convex simplicial polytope. Although some general theorems are quoted without proof, the concrete interpretations via simplicial geometry should make the text accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry.",Mathematics,3,0,toric variety algebraic variety arising elementary geometric combinatorial object convex polytopes euclidean space vertex lattice point since many algebraic geometry notion singularity birational map cycle homology intersection theory riemannroch translate simple fact polytopes toric variety provide marvelous source example algebraic geometry direction general fact algebraic geometry implication polytopes problem number lattice point contain spite fact toric variety special spectrum algebraic variety provide remarkably useful testing ground general theoriesthe aim minicourse develop foundation study toric variety example describe relation application text concludes stanley theorem characterizing number simplicies dimension convex simplicial polytope although general theorem quoted without proof concrete interpretation via simplicial geometry make text accessible beginner algebraic geometry

integrable Hamiltonian systems are revisited: Nekhoroshev theorem, concerning exponential lower bounds for the stability time (effective stability), and KAM theorem, concerning the preservation of a majority of the nonresonant invariant tori (perpetual stability). To stress the relationship between both theorems, a common approach is given to their proof, consisting of bringing the system to a normal form constructed through the Lie series method. The estimates obtained for the size of the remainder rely on bounds of the associated vectorfields, allowing to get the ""optimal"" stability exponent in Nekhoroshev theorem for quasiconvex systems. On the other hand, a direct and complete proof of the isoenergetic KAM theorem is obtained. Moreover, a modification of the proof leads to the notion of nearly-invariant torus, which constitutes a bridge between KAM and Nekhoroshev theorems.",Mathematics,2,0,two main stability result nearly integrable hamiltonian system revisited nekhoroshev theorem concerning exponential lower bound stability time effective stability kam theorem concerning preservation majority nonresonant invariant torus perpetual stability stress relationship theorem common approach given proof consisting bringing system normal form constructed lie series method estimate obtained size remainder rely bound associated vectorfields allowing get optimal stability exponent nekhoroshev theorem quasiconvex system hand direct complete proof isoenergetic kam theorem obtained moreover modification proof lead notion nearlyinvariant torus constitutes bridge kam nekhoroshev theorem

Algorithmic complexity says an object x has a complexity K(x) equal to the length of the shortest (binary) program that describes x. It is a beautiful fact that these ideas are much the same. In fact, it is roughly true that EK(X) - H. Moreover, if we let Pu(x) = Pr{U prints x} be the probability that a given computer U prints x when given a random program, it can be shown that log(1/Pu(x)) - K(x) for all x, thus establishing a vital link between the "" universal"" probability measure Pu and the "" universal"" complexity K.

The book aims to give the reader an understanding of the interrelationships of the three basic theories of physics. The first two chapters give the necessary mathematical background in differential geometry, Lie groups, and symplectic geometry. In chapter three a symplectic description of Galilean and relativistic mechanics is given, culminating in the classification of elementary particles (relativistic and non-relativistic, with or without spin, with or without mass). In the fourth chapter statistic mechanics is put into symplectic form, finishing with a symplectic description of the kinetic theory of gases and the computation of specific heats. The final chapter covers the author's theory of geometric quantization, and included in this chapter are the derivations of the various wave equations, and the construction of the Fock space.

Two main aspects of these tendencies are illustrated here with results of an investigation of students about thermodynamics: 1. 1.

Such a reduction of the number of variables may also be obtained by combining two of them, as if they were two facets of the same variable.

The latter was found to have a greater ability for discrimination between structural isomers than all known topological indices and to be a very appropriate measure of branching. All the quantities related to the distance matrix (two information measures, the Weiner number and the largest eigenvalue of the characteristic polynomial) were found to reflect in the same way the main features of molecular branching. On this basis, as well as on the basis of general expressions for information content and Wiener number derived for tree graphs, the essence of molecular branching was expressed in a number of rules. It was shown that these theoretical rules on branching are in agreement with the intuitive understanding of branching and are reflected in a large number of molecular properties.",Mathematics,4,0,information theory used defining several measure topological property molecule namely information adjacency incidence polynomial coefficient adjacency matrix distance molecular graph latter found greater ability discrimination structural isomer known topological index appropriate measure branching quantity related distance matrix two information measure weiner number largest eigenvalue characteristic polynomial found reflect way main feature molecular branching basis well basis general expression information content wiener number derived tree graph essence molecular branching expressed number rule shown theoretical rule branching agreement intuitive understanding branching reflected large number molecular property

These conditions are derived from the connectivity graph, which describes how the oscillators are connected. In particular, we show how such a sufficient condition is dependent on the algebraic connectivity of the connectivity graph. Intuition tells us that if the oscillators are more ""closely connected"" to each other, then they are more likely to synchronize. We discuss how to quantify connectedness in graph-theoretical terms and its relation to algebraic connectivity and show that our results are in accordance with this intuition. We also give an upper bound on the coupling conductance required for synchronization for arbitrary graphs, which is in the order of n/sup 2/, where n is the number of oscillators. >",Mathematics,1,0,letter show algebraic graph theory used derive sufficient condition array resistively coupled nonlinear oscillator synchronize condition derived connectivity graph describes oscillator connected particular show sufficient condition dependent algebraic connectivity connectivity graph intuition tell u oscillator closely connected likely synchronize discus quantify connectedness graphtheoretical term relation algebraic connectivity show result accordance intuition also give upper bound coupling conductance required synchronization arbitrary graph order nsup n number oscillator

The use of alternative techniques for the design of sculptured surfaces in the context of the tensor-product B-spline surface representation is explored. New techniques for modelling with B-splines are developed and some previous instances of surface design tools that are recorded in the literature will be adapted and extended for the B-spline representation.

The ensemble average of its formal integral defines the relaxation operator Φ(t) of the system. By the definition Φ(t) = exp K(t), the cumulant function K(t) may be introduced. Some general properties are first discussed for a simple example of an oscillator with random frequency modulation and then, concepts of slow and fast modulation are considered. These concepts can be generalized to more general types of stochastic Liouville equations.

This thesis is an exposition of recent results in this field, in particular of a result of Kumar [Kum11] regarding occurrence obstructions.

Then we focus on the permanent versus determinant problem and outline its translation into an orbit separation problem. Next, we discuss some techniques for separating orbits in the permanent versus determinant setting. Finally, we focus on the occurrence obstruction approach and give an exposition of the negative result of Kumar regarding this approach.

A search of the literature seemed to indicate that various theorems had been conjectured but none actually proved.f For example, L. Euler stated without proof that every integer of the form 47+2 is a sum of two primes each of the form 47 + 1. Even the weaker statement that every integer of the form 4/+2 is a sum of two integers which have all their prime factors of the form 4/+1 has not yet been proved. In view of the absence of any definite results in the literature it seems worthwhile to point out that some very interesting theorems can be obtained in an elementary way. This is done in Part I of this paper and the results are summarized in Theorems 1, 2, and 3 below. In Part II we use the method of Viggo BrunJ to prove a general theorem and from this we deduce Theorems 4 and 5 below.",Mathematics,4,0,prime factor aare given form search literature seemed indicate various theorem conjectured none actually provedf example l euler stated without proof every integer form sum two prime form even weaker statement every integer form sum two integer prime factor form yet proved view absence definite result literature seems worthwhile point interesting theorem obtained elementary way done part paper result summarized theorem part ii use method viggo brunj prove general theorem deduce theorem

We then discuss the closability of the same operators from $L^q(\mu)$ to $L^p(\mu)$; we give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for closability, but we do not have an exact characterization. As a corollary we obtain that classical differential operators such as gradient, divergence and jacobian determinant are closable from $L^q(\mu)$ to $L^p(\mu)$ only if $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

978,d66c93134b8345d76c6d4d25cab52abb160fee67,A Brief Introduction to Spectral Graph Theory,"Spectral graph theory starts by associating matrices to graphs, notably, the adjacency matrix and the laplacian matrix. The general theme is then, firstly, to compute or estimate the eigenvalues of such matrices, and secondly, to relate the eigenvalues to structural properties of graphs. As it turns out, the spectral perspective is a powerful tool. Some of its loveliest applications concern facts that are, in principle, purely graph-theoretic or combinatorial. To give just one example, spectral ideas are a key ingredient in the proof of the so-called Friendship Theorem: if, in a group of people, any two persons have exactly one common friend, then there is a person who is everybody’s friend. This text is an introduction to spectral graph theory, but it could also be seen as an invitation to algebraic graph theory. On the one hand, there is, of course, the linear algebra that underlies the spectral ideas in graph theory. On the other hand, most of our examples are graphs of algebraic origin. The two recurring sources are Cayley graphs of groups, and graphs built out of finite fields. In the study of such graphs, some further algebraic ingredients (e.g., characters) naturally come up. The table of contents gives, as it should, a good glimpse of where is this text going. Very broadly, the first half is devoted to graphs, finite fields, and how they come together. This part is meant as an appealing and meaningful motivation. It provides a context that frames and fuels much of the second, spectral, half. Most sections have one or two exercises. Their position within the text is a hint. The exercises are optional, in the sense that virtually nothing in the main body depends on them. But the exercises are often of the non-trivial variety, and they should enhance the text in an interesting way. The hope is that the reader will enjoy them. We assume a basic familiarity with linear algebra, finite fields, and groups, but not necessarily with graph theory. This, again, betrays our algebraic perspective. This text is based on a course I taught in Göttingen, in the Fall of 2015. I would like to thank Jerome Baum for his help with some of the drawings.

At the same time, the Carnot cycle model developed by the author predicts that the central pressure of mature cyclones is independent of the magnitude of the exchange coefficients. The author presents numerical simulations that prove this last prediction false and suggest that the reason for this failure is the neglect of eye dynamics in the steady-state theory.

1005,8ed0f218cf2171827193e4ff45038178d8143c4a,Targeting Apoptosis Pathways in Cancer Therapy,"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a mechanism by which cells undergo death to control cell proliferation or in response to DNA damage. The understanding of apoptosis has provided the basis for novel targeted therapies that can induce death in cancer cells or sensitize them to established cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. These novel agents include those targeting the extrinsic pathway such as tumor necrosis factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand receptor 1, and those targeting the intrinsic Bcl‐2 family pathway such as antisense bcl‐2 oligonucleotides. Many pathways and proteins control the apoptosis machinery. Examples include p53, the nuclear factor kappa B, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway, and the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway. These can be targeted by specific modulators such as bortezomib, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as CCI‐779 and RAD 001. Because these pathways may be preferentially altered in tumor cells, there is potential for a selective effect in tumors sparing normal tissue.

Two different species of Hepatozoon infect dogs - Hepatozoon canis in the Old World and South America, and Hepatozoon americanum in the southern USA. H canis infection varies from being asymptomatic in dogs with a low parasitaemia, to causing severe disease with anaemia, profound lethargy and cachexia in dogs with large numbers of circulating parasites. H americanum infection manifests mainly as gait abnormalities and musculoskeletal pain due to myositis and periosteal bone lesions. Feline hepatozoonosis is associated with muscular pathology and is often reported in conjunction with a retroviral disease. The diagnosis of hepatozoonosis relies mainly on the detection of blood gamonts in the case of H canis infection, and on muscle biopsy showing tissue cysts and pyogranulomas for H americanum infection. Therapy for both forms of the disease involves long-term treatment with combinations of antiprotozoal drugs. The control of hepatozoonosis in small animals relies on effective use of topical parasiticides and prevention of ingestion of blood-sucking arthropod hosts by animals when grooming or scavenging.",Medicine,3,0,article discus pathogenesis diagnosis treatment hepatozoonosis haemoparasitic disease transmitted ingestion arthropod vector two different specie hepatozoon infect dog hepatozoon canis old world south america hepatozoon americanum southern usa h canis infection varies asymptomatic dog low parasitaemia causing severe disease anaemia profound lethargy cachexia dog large number circulating parasite h americanum infection manifest mainly gait abnormality musculoskeletal pain due myositis periosteal bone lesion feline hepatozoonosis associated muscular pathology often reported conjunction retroviral disease diagnosis hepatozoonosis relies mainly detection blood gamonts case h canis infection muscle biopsy showing tissue cyst pyogranulomas h americanum infection therapy form disease involves longterm treatment combination antiprotozoal drug control hepatozoonosis small animal relies effective use topical parasiticides prevention ingestion bloodsucking arthropod host animal grooming scavenging

In PDT, a photosensitizer (PS) is administered that can be activated by light of a specific wavelength, which causes selective damage to the tumor and its surrounding vasculature. The success of PDT is limited by the difficulty in administering photosensitizers (PSs) with low water solubility, which compromises the clinical use of several molecules. Incorporation of PSs in nanostructured drug delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), hydrogels, liposomes, liquid crystals, dendrimers, and cyclodextrin is a potential strategy to overcome this difficulty. Additionally, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems may improve the transcytosis of a PS across epithelial and endothelial barriers and afford the simultaneous co-delivery of two or more drugs. Based on this, the application of nanotechnology in medicine may offer numerous exciting possibilities in cancer treatment and improve the efficacy of available therapeutics. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems for photodynamic therapy of cancer.",Medicine,3,0,photodynamic therapy pdt promising alternative approach improved cancer treatment pdt photosensitizer p administered activated light specific wavelength cause selective damage tumor surrounding vasculature success pdt limited difficulty administering photosensitizers ps low water solubility compromise clinical use several molecule incorporation ps nanostructured drug delivery system polymeric nanoparticles pnps solid lipid nanoparticles slns nanostructured lipid carrier nlcs gold nanoparticles aunps hydrogel liposome liquid crystal dendrimers cyclodextrin potential strategy overcome difficulty additionally nanotechnologybased drug delivery system may improve transcytosis p across epithelial endothelial barrier afford simultaneous codelivery two drug based application nanotechnology medicine may offer numerous exciting possibility cancer treatment improve efficacy available therapeutic therefore aim paper review nanotechnologybased drug delivery system photodynamic therapy cancer

Twenty-four maxillary fourth premolar teeth were harvested from dog cadavers. Samples consisted of teeth with surrounding alveolar bone potted in polycarbonate cylinders filled with acrylic. The cylinders were held by an aluminum device at an angle of 60° with respect to the ground. An axial compression test was performed, creating a force upon the occluso-palatal aspects of the main cusps of the crowns of the teeth. The highest compressive force prior to failure was considered the maximum force sustained by the teeth. Results showed the mean maximum force (± SD) sustained by the tested teeth at the point of fracture was 1,281 N (± 403 N) at a mean impact angle (± SD) of 59.7° (± 5.2°). The most common fracture type that occurred among all samples was a complicated crown fracture (n = 12), followed by an uncomplicated crown fracture (n = 6), complicated crown-root fracture (n = 5), and uncomplicated crown-root fracture (n = 1). There was no statistically significant correlation between dog breed, age, weight, impact angle, crown height or crown diameter, and the maximum force applied at the point of fracture. The only independent variable that remained significantly associated with maximum force was the crown height to diameter ratio (p = 0.005), suggesting that a decreased ratio increases tooth fracture resistance.

In this Account, we describe our quest for the ideal targeted therapeutic agent. This effort began with a search for ligands that would bind selectively to pathologic cells, displaying no affinity for healthy cells. After identification of an optimal targeting ligand, effort was focused on construction of linkers that would carry the attached drug to pathologic cells with receptors for the selected ligand. In the case of cancer, we exploited the well-characterized up-regulation of folate receptors on malignant cells to target folate-linked pharmaceuticals to cancer tissues in vivo. Drugs that have been linked to folic acid for tumor-selective drug delivery to date include (i) protein toxins, (ii) chemotherapeutic agents, (iii) gene therapy vectors, (iv) oligonucleotides (including small interfering RNA (siRNA)), (v) radioimaging agents, (vi) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, (vii) liposomes with entrapped drugs, (viii) radiotherapeutic agents, (ix) immunotherapeutic agents, and (x) enzyme constructs for prodrug therapy. Current clinical trials of four folate-linked drugs demonstrate that folate receptor-targeting holds great promise for increasing the potency while reducing toxicity of many cancer therapies. In the course of developing folate-conjugated drugs for cancer, we discovered that folate receptors are also overexpressed on activated (but not resting or quiescent) macrophages. Recognizing that activated macrophages either cause or contribute to such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, lupus, inflammatory osteoarthritis, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury, glomerulonephritis, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, Sjogren's disease, and vasculitis, we initiated studies aimed at developing folate-conjugated imaging and therapeutic agents for the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases.

It has been much discussed whether the extrapyramidal symptoms are a necessary condition for obtaining anti-psychotic effect (Fliigel, 1956) or an inevitable consequence of the treatment (Haase, 1961 ), or a therapeutically beneficial effect of the phenothiazines on the central nervous system (Bordeleau & Gratton, 1958; Delay & Deniker, 1959). Several authors conclude that extrapyramidal symptoms are not necessary for obtaining anti-psychotic effect (Faurbye et al., 1959; Goldman, 1961; Cole & Clyde, 1961), and Uhrbrand & Faurbye (1960) regard the extrapyramidal symptoms as harmful side effects and assert that they may be irreversibIe.

The ultimate goal in modern restorative dentistry is to achieve “white” and “pink” esthetics in esthetically important zones. “White esthetics” is the natural dentition or the restoration of dental hard tissues with suitable materials. “Pink esthetics” refers to the surrounding soft-tissues, which includes the interdental papilla and gingiva that can enhance or diminish the esthetic result. Reconstruction of the lost interdental papilla is one of the most challenging and least predictable problems. Restoration and maintenance of these tissues with adequate surgical and prosthetic techniques are a real challenge in modern esthetic dentistry.

He developed smaller diameter blunt cannulas. To add safety he also developed the wet technique to reduce blood loss. Tumescent anaesthesia described by Klein in 1987 made large volume liposuction safer allowing for more refined body contouring through significantly minimising blood loss. Liposuction journey started as mechanical debulking that evolved over the last 4 decades into a refined high definition body contouring and proportioning surgery, thus making sculpturing a shape of figurine possible. To achieve such high definition body sculpting technology including Laser, and Vaser not only added safety, however, they also achieved outcomes that cannot be matched with the older methods of liposuction, under local anaesthesia.

The ANOVA on factor scores in the whole subsample of 1,264 subjects showed a significant difference on delusion factor in allele analysis (P = 0.007), and in genotype one (P = 0.018), with DRD4*Long containing variants associated with severe symptomatology. The analysis in the replication subjects only (n = 803) showed a trend in the same direction, though not reaching the significance level.

Still, its detection by amplification method has limitations because of false-positive signals and difficulty in designing target-specific primers. CRISPR-Cas-based fluorescent biosensors have been developed but also need the amplification step for the detection. In this study, for the first time CRISPR-Cas12a based nucleic acid amplification-free fluorescent biosensor was developed to detect cfDNA by a metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) using DNA-functionalized Au nanoparticle (AuNP). Upon activating the CRISPR-Cas12a complex by the target cfDNA and subsequent single-strand DNA (ssDNA) degradation between AuNP and fluorophore, MEF occurred with color changes from purple to red-purple. Using this system, breast cancer gene-1 (BRCA-1) can be detected with very high sensitivity in 30 min.

The cycloid psychoses with low heritability and a good long‐term prognosis were found to be significantly associated with first‐trimester respiratory infection (i.e. influenza and febrile cold). Furthermore, maternal infection seems to predict an early onset in cycloids. In manic depression, we failed to identify a significant link with maternal gestational infection or other obstetric complications. These findings are discussed in the light of our previous reports of an excess of maternal gestational infections during the second trimester in chronic schizophrenics.

This can be due to avulsion of bone substance during the accident itself or due to resorption of the alveolar crest that takes place afterwards. Shortage of bone can prevent proper positioning of dental implants unless the volume of bone is increased before implantation. In the maxillary anterior area, this is also an esthetic problem. Several treatment modalities have been presented to augment the bone. This report reviews the latest literature on bone grafting, bone substitutes, guided bone regeneration, osteocompression and distraction which are potentially useful in the anterior maxilla. A special emphasis is paid to the versatility of using a crestal split osteotomy, by means of chisels and osteotomes to widen the narrow ridge.

Since time immemorial, there has been much anecdotal evidence that the fetus responds to sound. In contrast, until the late 19th Century, scientific evidence and opinion held that the newborn was deaf and only developed the ability to hear in the first weeks after birth. At the beginning of the 20th Century the prevailing scientific and clinical view changed and it was accepted that the newborn was able to hear at birth. This led to much speculation about, and limited experimental study of, when the individual first started to hear. Detailed study of the ontogency of auditory abilities had to wait until the 1980’s when scientific opinion regarding the abilities of the newborn changed and the ultrasound technology with which to observe the fetus in utero became widely available. Research thus commenced in earnest to investigate the response of the fetus to sound. Despite this increased interest in fetal hearing, experimental studies have concentrated upon the responsiveness to sound in late pregnancy and not on the developmental origine of auditory abilities. It is the aim of this review to examine the ontogenesis of hearing in the fetus.",Medicine,5,0,developmental origin ability hear subject much debate speculation since time immemorial much anecdotal evidence fetus responds sound contrast late th century scientific evidence opinion held newborn deaf developed ability hear first week birth beginning th century prevailing scientific clinical view changed accepted newborn able hear birth led much speculation limited experimental study individual first started hear detailed study ontogency auditory ability wait scientific opinion regarding ability newborn changed ultrasound technology observe fetus utero became widely available research thus commenced earnest investigate response fetus sound despite increased interest fetal hearing experimental study concentrated upon responsiveness sound late pregnancy developmental origine auditory ability aim review examine ontogenesis hearing fetus

Aesthetic considerations imply the creation of a glanslike structured tip. A review of the scarce literature on sculpturing of a glans is given. In cases in which microsurgical free-flap techniques are applied in our hospital, the glans is usually sculptured to its final appearance during the actual phalloplasty. If, on the other hand, an abdominal or inguinal skin flap is used, final sculpturing will be done as a subsequent separate procedure. From a review of the literature on this subject and from our experience, one may conclude that the Norfolk technique of coronal ridge and sulcus construction has best results. We consider Munawar's technique to be obsolete, since it tends to lead to flattening of the coronal ridge.",Medicine,2,0,one goal phalloplasty construction aesthetically appealing neophallus urethral meatus tip aesthetic consideration imply creation glanslike structured tip review scarce literature sculpturing glans given case microsurgical freeflap technique applied hospital glans usually sculptured final appearance actual phalloplasty hand abdominal inguinal skin flap used final sculpturing done subsequent separate procedure review literature subject experience one may conclude norfolk technique coronal ridge sulcus construction best result consider munawars technique obsolete since tends lead flattening coronal ridge

Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting a desired antigen has shown extraordinary antitumor activity, especially in refractory and relapsed B-cell malignancies. The most representative in this respect, as well as the most successful example, is CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, with the widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy, problems of resistance and relapse are starting to be considered.

Out of the many post-stroke disturbances, post-stroke depression, post-stroke anxiety, post-stroke emotional incontinence, post-stroke anger proneness, and post-stroke fatigue are frequent and important symptoms. These symptoms are distressing for both the patients and their caregivers, and negatively influence the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and are therefore often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been under-studied, and are under-recognized. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare.

A 1-year-old sexually intact female Netherland dwarf rabbit was examined because of a 3-week history of signs of lethargy, decreased appetite, left unilateral exophthalmia, a previous draining sinus from a left maxillary facial abscess, and bilateral nasal discharge.


CLINICAL FINDINGS
The rabbit weighed 1.0 kg (2.2 lb) and had a body condition score of 1.5/5. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle atrophy, bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge, and severe left-sided exophthalmia. Diagnostic investigation revealed anemia, neutrophilia, severe dental disease, a superficial corneal ulcer of the left eye, and a retrobulbar abscess.


TREATMENT AND OUTCOME
Stomatoscopy-aided dental trimming, tooth removal, and abscess debridement were performed. Antimicrobials were flushed into the tooth abscess cavity, and antimicrobial treatment was initiated on the basis of cytologic findings and results of bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Two months after the initial surgery, minimal exophthalmia was evident and no further physical, radiographic, or ultrasonographic changes were evident.

This produces intense, generalized, but transient, vasoconstriction with a resultant shift of blood from the high-resistance systemic circulation to the lowresistance pulmonary circulation. Marked increases in pulmonary vascular pressures and marked increases in pulmonary blood volume then produce pulmonary edema because of the hydrostatic effect of increased pulmonary capillary pressure. In addition, pulmonary hypertension and hypervolemia injure pulmonary blood vessels, altering pulmonary capillary permeability and producing lung hemorrhage.

1117,071402a0c2befad53283ae22fd1bde8a5efb7278,Trends in veterinary cancer imaging.,"With the recent advances in diagnostic imaging technology, cancer imaging in veterinary medicine has become more specific for disease diagnosis, more accurate for determining tumour margins and more sensitive for detecting metastatic disease. Ultrasound provides highly detailed images of parenchymal masses and infiltrative lesions while providing a means for aspiration or biopsy using real-time image guidance. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance-imaging techniques provide exquisite anatomical resolution that improves diagnostic accuracy, provides an accurate means of radiation or surgical treatment planning and a quantitative means for monitoring response to therapy. In addition to traditional anatomic imaging, new techniques are being developed for estimating functional parameters such as tumour perfusion, cell metabolism and gene expression. While conventional planar scintigraphy has been available for some time, newer nuclear imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography promise to further improve the accuracy of initial tumour diagnosis and staging and determination of response to therapy. Although many of these functional techniques are not yet clinically available, it is highly likely that some will be integrated into routine clinical practice in the near future.",Medicine,5,0,recent advance diagnostic imaging technology cancer imaging veterinary medicine become specific disease diagnosis accurate determining tumour margin sensitive detecting metastatic disease ultrasound provides highly detailed image parenchymal mass infiltrative lesion providing mean aspiration biopsy using realtime image guidance computed tomography magnetic resonanceimaging technique provide exquisite anatomical resolution improves diagnostic accuracy provides accurate mean radiation surgical treatment planning quantitative mean monitoring response therapy addition traditional anatomic imaging new technique developed estimating functional parameter tumour perfusion cell metabolism gene expression conventional planar scintigraphy available time newer nuclear imaging modality positron emission tomography promise improve accuracy initial tumour diagnosis staging determination response therapy although many functional technique yet clinically available highly likely integrated routine clinical practice near future

Unlike press-on nails, sculptured nails are not preformed, but molded onto the natural nail plate. There are two types of sculptured nails, both of which are acrylate based (1). The ®rst type is composed of either methyl methacrylate monomer or of longer chain methacrylate esters combined with a polymethylmethacrylate polymer. When the monomer liquid is mixed with the polymer powder, a polymerization reaction occurs in ordinary daylight (1). The second type consists of the same components, but the polymerization reaction takes place by the ``photobonding technique'' with the person's hands placed under UV radiation (2).

Quant aux expositions scientifiques, 130 etaient consacrees a l'imagerie cardio-pulmonaire, et concernaient pour 2/3 environ l'imagerie du poumon (TDM, puis scintigraphie, puis loin derriere, IRM). Toujours autant d'actualite, aussi bien en terme de frequence que de sante publique, se decline l'imagerie du cancer bronchopulmonaire. Ce sujet etait presente en deux volets. Le premier abordait le diagnostic du nodule pulmonaire solitaire, l'accent etant primitivement mis sur les problemes medico-legaux (une manne pour les avocats americains) poses par le nombre de faux negatifs en radiographie standard (SS337). Les insuffisances de detection etaient rappelees, des circonstances de realisation des cliches a la decision diagnostique finale (nodule non vu, vu mais non reconnu). Dans ces erreurs diagnostiques, ce n'est pas la taille du nodule la principale responsable mais son contraste par rapport aux structures adjacentes. La TDM, une fois le nodule detecte, peut apporter des elements de caracterisation (SS337) ; la presence de graisse est hautement evocatrice de la benignite, de meme que la forme des calcifications lorsqu'elles sont presentes (centrales, homogenes). A l'inverse, les calcifications malignes sont heterogenes, excentriques. La taille des nodules > 30 mm est plus en faveur de la malignite (SS337, SS345). Le contexte est egalement un element important (SS345); la frequence des nodules malins est accrue (56 %) chez les patients ayant (eu) un cancer connu par rapport aux nodules de decouverte fortuite (44 %, p < 0,05). Un des elements recents des plus utiles est la prise de contraste des nodules; la technique consiste en un passage sans injection, puis 130 secondes apres injection a 2 ml/sec de produit iode; les nodules se rehaussant de plus de 20 UH ont 90 % de probabilite d'etre malins (SS338, SS339). La scintigraphie au 18-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) est une nouvelle methode de caracterisation, la fixation etant plus elevee au sein du nodule lorsqu'il est malin (SS338, SE0280CH).

This paper reports the incidence of radiographic lesions of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the femoropatellar joint relative to the development of clinical symptoms in the 1989 foal crop, and the clinical symptoms, radiographic features and outcome of the 1990 and 1991 foal crops affected with OCD at the same Thoroughbred farm. In the 1989 foal crop, 23 of 96 yearlings were identified with clinical and/or radiographic signs of OCD. They had an average age of 12.6 months at identification. Eighteen cases had clinical and radiographic signs of osteochondrosis, 3 had clinical signs in the stifles without radiographic signs and 2 had radiographic signs of osteochondrosis but no clinical signs (one eventually became symptomatic). Of the cases with clinical signs but no radiographic signs, one subsequently developed radiographic signs and the other 2 had bilateral clinical signs and unilateral radiographic signs. Seven horses had surgery at the time of clinical and radiographic diagnosis; 5 subsequently raced, 1 is in training and 1 has persistent problems. Of 11 cases not operated initially, 6 raced, 3 had no follow-up, 1 became a jumper and 1 was operated later. In the 1990 foal crop, 13 of 120 foals were diagnosed with femoropatellar OCD. The average age at diagnosis was 9 months. Nine of the foals had radiographic lesions, 3 had equivocal radiographic lesions (1 progressed to an obvious lesion) and 1 had no radiographic lesions of the femoropatellar joint (but did have them in the fetlocks). All but one horse were treated conservatively. Of the horses with radiographic lesions initially, 2 have raced, 2 are still unraced, 3 have lameness and 2 were used for non-racing careers. One horse had equivocal lesions initially but these progressed. In the 1991 foal crop, there were 16 cases of femoropatellar OCD diagnosed out of 125 foals.

By proper biopharmaceutic design, the rate and extent of drug absorption (also called as bioavailability) or the systemic delivery of drugs to the body can be varied from rapid and complete absorption to slow and sustained absorption depending upon the desired therapeutic objective. Phytomedicine have served as the foundation for a larger fraction of the current pharmacopeia. But the delivery of phytomedicine is always problematic due to poor aqueous solubility, poor permeation, low systemic availability, instability and extensive first pass metabolism. Current review will discuss in detail about how nanotechnology can enhance the bioavilability and bioactivity of the phytomedicine.",Medicine,5,0,achieve desired therapeutic objective drug product must deliver active drug optimal rate amount proper biopharmaceutic design rate extent drug absorption also called bioavailability systemic delivery drug body varied rapid complete absorption slow sustained absorption depending upon desired therapeutic objective phytomedicine served foundation larger fraction current pharmacopeia delivery phytomedicine always problematic due poor aqueous solubility poor permeation low systemic availability instability extensive first pas metabolism current review discus detail nanotechnology enhance bioavilability bioactivity phytomedicine

To evaluate the different methodologies used to monitor anesthetic depth and to review the principles and potential applications of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in veterinary anesthesia.


DATABASES USED
Medline (1966 to present); Pubmed (mid-1960s to present); personal files.


CONCLUSIONS
Current anesthetic monitoring techniques rely on indirect measures of corticocerebral arousal after a noxious stimulus. Some anesthetics and pre-anesthetics suppress responses that are used to gauge adequate hypnosis and analgesia. The BIS is a direct measure of corticocerebral activation and is inversely related to the degree of hypnosis. Dynamic changes in the BIS after a noxious stimulus may signify early nociceptive activation of the cerebral cortex and may be a useful marker of inadequate analgesia. However, application of this technique during the use of various drug combinations (i.e. clinical anesthesia) will require further research and understanding.",Medicine,5,0,objective evaluate different methodology used monitor anesthetic depth review principle potential application bispectral index bi monitoring veterinary anesthesia database used medline present pubmed mids present personal file conclusion current anesthetic monitoring technique rely indirect measure corticocerebral arousal noxious stimulus anesthetic preanesthetics suppress response used gauge adequate hypnosis analgesia bi direct measure corticocerebral activation inversely related degree hypnosis dynamic change bi noxious stimulus may signify early nociceptive activation cerebral cortex may useful marker inadequate analgesia however application technique use various drug combination ie clinical anesthesia require research understanding

Because of this resistance, there is a need for a new cancer therapy that can attack these persistent cells. CAR T cell therapy utilizes the patient’s own immune system to attack and potentially eliminate these cancer cells. These cells have successfully been used against B cell malignancies, however, not much success has been seen when used against solid tumors. Solid tumors pose many challenges and threats these T cells must overcome in order to produce any anti-tumor effect. Challenges researchers run into include finding a suitable antigen to target, successfully trafficking to and infiltrating the tumor, and overcoming the microenvironment of the tumor.

Since there is no diagnostic test for tics, the clinical recognition of phenomenology is essential for proper diagnosis. Some, and possibly most, motor tics are preceded by a premonitory urge or sensation that is relieved by the execution of the tic and thus can be difficult to differentiate from compulsions, hence the term compulsive tic. In the schema of categorization of movements, most tics can be classified as either unvoluntaryin response to an inner sensory stimulus or to an unwanted feeling compulsionor involuntarytics that are usually suppressible. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical, anatomical, and physiologic substrates for the different forms of tics.

Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) plays a vital role in inhibiting immune responses and promoting self-tolerance through modulating the activity of T-cells, activating apoptosis of antigen-specific T cells and inhibiting apoptosis of regulatory T cells. Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a trans-membrane protein that is considered to be a co-inhibitory factor of the immune response, it can combine with PD-1 to reduce the proliferation of PD-1 positive cells, inhibit their cytokine secretion and induce apoptosis. PD-L1 also plays an important role in various malignancies where it can attenuate the host immune response to tumor cells.

Injection-induced earthquakes pose a serious seismic hazard but also offer an opportunity to gain insight into earthquake physics. Currently used models relating the maximum magnitude of injection-induced earthquakes to injection parameters do not incorporate rupture physics. We develop theoretical estimates, validated by simulations, of the size of ruptures induced by localized pore-pressure perturbations and propagating on prestressed faults. Our model accounts for ruptures growing beyond the perturbed area and distinguishes self-arrested from runaway ruptures. We develop a theoretical scaling relation between the largest magnitude of self-arrested earthquakes and the injected volume and find it consistent with observed maximum magnitudes of injection-induced earthquakes over a broad range of injected volumes, suggesting that, although runaway ruptures are possible, most injection-induced events so far have been self-arrested ruptures.",Medicine,4,0,theoretical model rupture arrest indicates injectioninduced earthquake selfarrested injectioninduced earthquake pose serious seismic hazard also offer opportunity gain insight earthquake physic currently used model relating maximum magnitude injectioninduced earthquake injection parameter incorporate rupture physic develop theoretical estimate validated simulation size rupture induced localized porepressure perturbation propagating prestressed fault model account rupture growing beyond perturbed area distinguishes selfarrested runaway rupture develop theoretical scaling relation largest magnitude selfarrested earthquake injected volume find consistent observed maximum magnitude injectioninduced earthquake broad range injected volume suggesting although runaway rupture possible injectioninduced event far selfarrested rupture

Repeats are separated by spacers, some of them homologous to sequences in mobile genetic elements. Although the whole process involved remains uncharacterized, it is known that new spacers are incorporated into CRISPR loci of the host during a phage challenge, conferring specific resistance against the virus. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that such interference is based on small RNAs carrying a spacer. These RNAs would guide the defence apparatus to foreign molecules carrying sequences that match the spacers. Despite this essential role, the spacer uptake mechanism has not been addressed. A first step forward came from the detection of motifs associated with spacer precursors (proto-spacers) of Streptococcus thermophilus, revealing a specific recognition of donor sequences in this species. Here we show that the conservation of proto-spacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) is a common theme for the most diverse CRISPR systems. The PAM sequence depends on the CRISPR-CAS variant, implying that there is a CRISPR-type-specific (motif-directed) choice of the spacers, which subsequently determines the interference target. PAMs also direct the orientation of spacers in the repeat arrays. Remarkably, observations based on such polarity argue against a recognition of the spacer precursors on transcript RNA molecules as a general rule.",Medicine,4,0,clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr associated crisprassociated sequence ca protein constitute novel antiviral defence system widespread prokaryote repeat separated spacers homologous sequence mobile genetic element although whole process involved remains uncharacterized known new spacers incorporated crispr locus host phage challenge conferring specific resistance virus moreover demonstrated interference based small rna carrying spacer rna would guide defence apparatus foreign molecule carrying sequence match spacers despite essential role spacer uptake mechanism addressed first step forward came detection motif associated spacer precursor protospacers streptococcus thermophilus revealing specific recognition donor sequence specie show conservation protospacer adjacent motif pams common theme diverse crispr system pam sequence depends crisprcas variant implying crisprtypespecific motifdirected choice spacers subsequently determines interference target pams also direct orientation spacers repeat array remarkably observation based polarity argue recognition spacer precursor transcript rna molecule general rule

All teeth were normal and were rasped to a standard considered satisfactory in practice. Six teeth from each horse served as untreated controls. Following treatment, the teeth were extracted and the clinical crown removed and prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Teeth were also extracted and examined from a horse that had excessive dental treatment previously. Dental debris created by the procedures was collected and examined. All three rasp techniques resulted in amputation of odontoblast processes. The solid carbide blade cut deep gouges and grooves into the surface of the dentin, chipping the enamel and peripheral cement. No smear layer was created. Rasping with a tungsten chip blade created a partial smear layer and a smoother surface than the solid carbide blade. The electrically-driven bur produced a complete smear layer and removed all dental tissues to a smooth layer. The enamel had also been damaged by the electric bur. Crown particles collected after the procedures were larger following hand rasping compared with particles produced by the electric bur. The extent of damage to sensitive and vital dentin tissue was of concern. Further studies are required to establish the optimum technique for rasping equine cheek teeth.",Medicine,2,0,two hand rasp tungsten chip blade solid carbide blade electricallydriven solid carbide axial bur used treat cheek teeth horse immediately postmortem teeth normal rasped standard considered satisfactory practice six teeth horse served untreated control following treatment teeth extracted clinical crown removed prepared scanning electron microscopy teeth also extracted examined horse excessive dental treatment previously dental debris created procedure collected examined three rasp technique resulted amputation odontoblast process solid carbide blade cut deep gouge groove surface dentin chipping enamel peripheral cement smear layer created rasping tungsten chip blade created partial smear layer smoother surface solid carbide blade electricallydriven bur produced complete smear layer removed dental tissue smooth layer enamel also damaged electric bur crown particle collected procedure larger following hand rasping compared particle produced electric bur extent damage sensitive vital dentin tissue concern study required establish optimum technique rasping equine cheek teeth

As I shall demonstrate below, the kind of process which gave rise to this fragmentation is already present in a Hippocratic text such as πeρί ίeρής νούσυν (On the Sacred Disease). To delineate the contours of ancient Greek medicine, I have focussed on the Hippocratic texts, on temple medicine and folk medicine, especially as exemplified in the corpus of magical papyri.

Although higher expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells is associated with a better immune response after Ab blockade, some PD-L1–negative patients also respond to this therapy. In the current study, we explored whether PD-L1 on tumor or host cells was essential for anti–PD-L1–mediated therapy in 2 different murine tumor models. Using real-time imaging in whole tumor tissues, we found that anti–PD-L1 Ab accumulates in tumor tissues, regardless of the status of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. We further observed that, while PD-L1 on tumor cells was largely dispensable for the response to checkpoint blockade, PD-L1 in host myeloid cells was essential for this response. Additionally, PD-L1 signaling in defined antigen-presenting cells (APCs) negatively regulated and inhibited T cell activation. PD-L1 blockade inside tumors was not sufficient to mediate regression, as limiting T cell trafficking reduced the efficacy of the blockade. Together, these findings demonstrate that PD-L1 expressed in APCs, rather than on tumor cells, plays an essential role in checkpoint blockade therapy, providing an insight into the mechanisms of this therapy.",Medicine,5,0,programmed deathligand pdl expression tumor cell essential cell impairment pdl blockade therapy shown unprecedented durable response several clinical study although higher expression pdl tumor cell associated better immune response ab blockade pdlnegative patient also respond therapy current study explored whether pdl tumor host cell essential antipdlmediated therapy different murine tumor model using realtime imaging whole tumor tissue found antipdl ab accumulates tumor tissue regardless status pdl expression tumor cell observed pdl tumor cell largely dispensable response checkpoint blockade pdl host myeloid cell essential response additionally pdl signaling defined antigenpresenting cell apc negatively regulated inhibited cell activation pdl blockade inside tumor sufficient mediate regression limiting cell trafficking reduced efficacy blockade together finding demonstrate pdl expressed apc rather tumor cell play essential role checkpoint blockade therapy providing insight mechanism therapy

Kraepelin, provides a solid foundation for contemporary psychiatry. Kraepelin's term, dementia praecox, was subsequently succeeded by E. Bleulev's term schizophrenia which represented a somewhat larger concept than the former. Since Bleuler's time, the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been made chiefly on the basis of psychological characteristics shown in the clinical picture rather than on the clinical course and outcome of the illness since its inception. As a result, the concept of the illness has been expanded and its boundaries have been obscured. Therefore, it seems only natural that contemporary views regarding the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are frequently in disagreement and are matters of controversy. This problemthe classification of schizophrenia was a subject matter of importance during the International Psychiatric Congress held in Zurich in 1957. The most troublesome of all diagnostic problems in our daily practice seems to be with the group of illnesses which show atypical features attributable to neither schizophrenia nor manic depressive psychosis.

Little attention has been paid, however, to the evolution of FN surgery, a subject with a remarkably rich and engaging history. In the early 13th century, Roland, an Italian surgeon, used a red hot iron to coapt severed nerve endings. In the 17th century, Ferrara, another Italian, sutured injured nerves with tortoise tendon dipped in hot red wine. It was not until the late 19th century that peripheral nerve suture became a subject of serious scientific study. Although it is ironic, the course of events suggests that the evolution of FN repair was greatly stimulated by the development of the modern mastoid operation. Whereas the simple mastoid operation practiced by Wilde (1853) and others carried little risk of FN injury, more adventuresome procedures such as radical mastoidectomy (Kessel, 1885) carried a much greater risk. The abundance of iatrogenic palsies during this era undoubtedly did much to motivate surgeons to seek a better means of restoring facial animation. Most surgeons would be surprised to learn that crossover anastomoses predated direct nerve repair by nearly half a century. In 1879, the German surgeon Drobnik performed the first facial-spinal accessory anastomosis. Over the next two decades, numerous articles were written (most notably by Sir Charles Balance and Harvey Cushing) on crossovers between the FN and cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII. Although a few tentative attempts at reapproximating severed FNs took place in the first two decades of this century, it was not until 1925 that an actual suture repair of an intratemporal injury was undertaken.

The pain response varies substantially from one person to another. The condition generally involves the facial surfaces of teeth near the cervical aspect and is very common in premolars and canines. The most widely accepted theory of how the pain occurs is Brannstrom's hydrodynamic theory, fluid movement within the dentinal tubules. The dental professional, using a variety of diagnostic techniques, will discern the condition from other conditions that may cause sensitive teeth. Treatment of the condition can be invasive or non-invasive in nature. The most inexpensive and efficacious first line of treatment for most patients is a dentifrice containing a desensitizing active ingredient such as potassium nitrate and/or stannous fluoride.

Whether autophagy observed in treated cancer cells represents a mechanism that allows tumor cells to survive therapy or a mechanism for initiating a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death remains controversial. To address this issue, the role of autophagy in a Myc-induced model of lymphoma generated from cells derived from p53ER(TAM)/p53ER(TAM) mice (with ER denoting estrogen receptor) was examined. Such tumors are resistant to apoptosis due to a lack of nuclear p53. Systemic administration of tamoxifen led to p53 activation and tumor regression followed by tumor recurrence. Activation of p53 was associated with the rapid appearance of apoptotic cells and the induction of autophagy in surviving cells. Inhibition of autophagy with either chloroquine or ATG5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) enhanced the ability of either p53 activation or alkylating drug therapy to induce tumor cell death. These studies provide evidence that autophagy serves as a survival pathway in tumor cells treated with apoptosis activators and a rationale for the use of autophagy inhibitors such as chloroquine in combination with therapies designed to induce apoptosis in human cancers.",Medicine,5,0,autophagy lysosomedependent degradative pathway frequently activated tumor cell treated chemotherapy radiation whether autophagy observed treated cancer cell represents mechanism allows tumor cell survive therapy mechanism initiating nonapoptotic form programmed cell death remains controversial address issue role autophagy mycinduced model lymphoma generated cell derived pertampertam mouse er denoting estrogen receptor examined tumor resistant apoptosis due lack nuclear p systemic administration tamoxifen led p activation tumor regression followed tumor recurrence activation p associated rapid appearance apoptotic cell induction autophagy surviving cell inhibition autophagy either chloroquine atg short hairpin rna shrna enhanced ability either p activation alkylating drug therapy induce tumor cell death study provide evidence autophagy serf survival pathway tumor cell treated apoptosis activator rationale use autophagy inhibitor chloroquine combination therapy designed induce apoptosis human cancer

1193,3c585bb6f96fdf20b6add5ab4e9c4aee56db21ac,Interleukin‐6: A Cytokine for Gerontolgists,"Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a multifunctional cytokine that presumably plays its major role as a mediator of several of the acute phase inflammatory responses. These include inflammatory cell and lymphocyte activation and hepatocellular stimulation of acute phase protein synthesis. IL‐6 expression is normally low, and serum levels are usually non‐detectable in the absence of inflammation. However, with advancing age, serum levels become detectable, and it is proposed that this reflects an age‐associated loss in the normal regulation of gene expression for this molecule. The cause of this is most likely multi‐factorial, but there is evidence that it relates to an age‐associated loss of T cell immunoregulatory functions as well as menopausal loss of estrogen. In any event, the “inappropriate” presence of IL‐6 results in many changes typical of chronic inflammation. There is also speculation that IL‐6 may contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases of late‐life including lymphoma, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease.

The emission properties of the compact H II region that surrounds the unresolved binary, and those of the extended nebular jet, have been analyzed from low-resolution IUE spectra of these regions. In particular, the UV line intensities observed in the jet appear variable on a time scale of about 1.5 yr. A new accretion disk model is proposed that explains the kinematic and ionization properties of discrete components which comprise the jet emission nebulosity, the appearance of the jet in the 1980s, and morphology that uniquely characterizes the R Aquarii system at radio, optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. 52 references.",Physics,3,0,ultraviolet spectrum range indicate extended nebular feature resemble jet peculiar variable r aquarii pec increased excitation emission property compact h ii region surround unresolved binary extended nebular jet analyzed lowresolution iue spectrum region particular uv line intensity observed jet appear variable time scale yr new accretion disk model proposed explains kinematic ionization property discrete component comprise jet emission nebulosity appearance jet morphology uniquely characterizes r aquarii system radio optical uv xray wavelength reference

From these images and IUE and TD-1 stellar spectra, the ratio of nebular to stellar flux was calculated. The ratio ranged from 0.577 to 0.921 at 1362 A and 0.681 to 0.916 at 1769 A with the spread in the ratio arising mainly from uncertainties in the sky background. In order to analyze these images, a model utilizing Monte Carlo techniques to describe radiative transfer in a spherical nebula with asymmetrically distributed stars was developed by elaborating on previous work by Witt. This model was used to determine the range of albedos reproducing the observed nebular-to-stellar flux ratios while allowing the scattering phase function asymmetry to vary between 0.0 and 0.8.

We show that bifurcations take place in particular for conformally invariant Lagrangians L = R n/ 2 √ g and prove that their solutions are conformally equivalent to solutions of Einstein equations. For 2–dimensional space–time we ﬁnd instead that the universal equation is always the equation of constant scalar curvature; the connection in this case is a Weyl connection, containing the Levi–Civita connection of the metric and an additional vectorﬁeld ensuing from conformal invariance.

It is shown that the equations of motion can be written in the same form in inertial and noninertial frames, with the effective electric and magnetic fields in the latter modified by inertial effects associated with centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations. These modifications depend on the particle charge-to-mass ratio, and also the vorticity, specific kinetic energy, and compressibility of the frame flow. The Newton–Lorentz, Vlasov, and Fokker–Planck equations in such a frame are derived. Reduced models such as gyrokinetic, drift-kinetic, and fluid equations are then derivable from these equations in the appropriate limits, using standard averaging procedures. The results are applied to tokamak plasmas rotating about the machine symmetry axis with a nonrelativistic but otherwise arbitrary toroidal flow velocity.

This is generally considered as an indication of binarity. To confirm it, we performed a photometric monitoring of the central star, and obtained images and spectra of the nebula. The nebular spectrum confirms that IPHASXJ211420.0+434136 is a planetary nebula of moderately high excitation.

The light curve of the central star reveals that it is an eclipsing binary system with an orbital period of 8.74h.Italsodisplays astrongirradiationeffect withan amplitude of 1.5mag.

Instead, a power law relationship is found given by Jsc∝Iα, where α ranges from 0.85 to 1. In a number of reports this deviation from unity is speculated to arise from the occurrence of bimolecular recombination. We demonstrate that the dependence of the photocurrent in bulk heterojunction solar cells is governed by the build-up of space-charge in the device as a consequence of a difference in electron- and hole mobility. We have verified this for an experimental model system in which the mobility difference can be tuned from one to three orders of magnitude by changing the annealing treatment.",Physics,3,0,typical feature polymerfullerene based solar cell current density shortcircuit condition jsc scale exactly linearly light intensity instead power law relationship found given jsciα α range number report deviation unity speculated arise occurrence bimolecular recombination demonstrate dependence photocurrent bulk heterojunction solar cell governed buildup spacecharge device consequence difference electron hole mobility verified experimental model system mobility difference tuned one three order magnitude changing annealing treatment

To be able to understand the properties of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and the universe on the whole it has become commonplace to invoke the presence of dark matter.

Direct imaging of nearby exoplanets and the circumstellar disks in which they form and evolve is challenging due to the high contrast ratio and small angular separation relative to the central star. Exoplanets are typically within 1 arcsec of, and between 4 and 10 orders of magnitude fainter than, the stars they orbit. To meet these challenges, ground-based telescopes must be equipped with extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems optimized to acquire high-contrast images of the immediate surrounding of nearby bright stars. Current ExAO systems have the sensitivity to image thermal emission from young massive planets in near-IR, while future systems deployed on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will image starlight reflected by lower-mass rocky planets.

A blind analysis avoids the possibility of experimenters biasing their result toward their own preconceptions by preventing them from knowing the answer until the analysis is complete. There is at least circumstantial evidence that such a bias has affected past measurements, and as experiments have become costlier and more difficult and hence harder to reproduce, the possibility of bias has become a more important issue than in the past. We describe here the motivations for performing a blind analysis, and give several modern examples of successful blind analysis strategies.",Physics,5,0,abstract past decade blind analysis become widely used tool nuclear particle physic measurement blind analysis avoids possibility experimenter biasing result toward preconception preventing knowing answer analysis complete least circumstantial evidence bias affected past measurement experiment become costlier difficult hence harder reproduce possibility bias become important issue past describe motivation performing blind analysis give several modern example successful blind analysis strategy

Historically, these studies have passed through three stages: (1) testing the power in the inverse-square laws of Newton and Coulomb, (2) seeking a nonzero value for the rest mass of photon or graviton, and (3) considering more degrees of freedom, allowing mass while preserving explicit gauge or general-coordinate invariance. Since the previous review the lower limit on the photon Compton wavelength has improved by four orders of magnitude, to about one astronomical unit, and rapid current progress in astronomy makes further advance likely. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. Meanwhile there are striking observations of astronomical motions that do not fit Einstein gravity with visible sources. ''Cold dark matter'' (slow, invisible classical particles) fits well at large scales. ''Modified Newtonian dynamics'' provides the best phenomenology at galactic scales. Satisfying this phenomenology is a requirement if dark matter, perhaps as invisible classical fields, could be correct here too.

This is done within the Hamiltonian formalism, and for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions D ≥ 4. A key rôle in the derivation is played by the Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric, and by the fact that the off-diagonal degrees of freedom, as well as the p-form degrees of freedom, get “asymptotically frozen” in this description.

We show that planets with masses smaller than one Jupiter mass do not survive the planetary nebula phase if located initially at orbital distances smaller than 3-5 AU. Planets more massive than two Jupiter masses around low-mass (1 M☉ on the main sequence) stars survive the planetary nebula stage down to orbital distances of ~3 AU. As the star evolves through the planetary nebula phase, an evaporation outflow will be established at the planet's surface. Evaporating planets may be detected using spectroscopic observations. Planets around white dwarfs with masses MWD ≳ 0.7 M☉ are generally expected to be found at orbital radii r ≳ 15 AU.

The favored theory invokes a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting hydrogen-rich material from a close companion until a thermonuclear runaway ensues that incinerates the white dwarf. However, simulations resulting from this single-degenerate, binary channel demand the presence of low-velocity Hα emission in spectra taken during the late nebular phase, since a portion of the companion's envelope becomes entrained in the ejecta. This hydrogen has never been detected, but has only rarely been sought. Here we present results from a campaign to obtain deep, nebular-phase spectroscopy of nearby Type Ia supernovae, and include multiepoch observations of two events: SN 2005am (slightly subluminous) and SN 2005cf (normally bright). No Hα emission is detected in the spectra of either object. An upper limit of 0.01 M☉ of solar abundance material in the ejecta is established from the models of Mattila et al., which, when coupled with the mass-stripping simulations of Marietta et al. and Meng et al., effectively rules out progenitor systems for these supernovae with secondaries close enough to the white dwarf to be experiencing Roche lobe overflow at the time of explosion. Alternative explanations for the absence of Hα emission, along with suggestions for future investigations necessary to confidently exclude them as possibilities, are critically evaluated.",Physics,5,0,despite intense scrutiny progenitor system give rise type ia supernova remains unknown favored theory invokes carbonoxygen white dwarf accreting hydrogenrich material close companion thermonuclear runaway ensues incinerates white dwarf however simulation resulting singledegenerate binary channel demand presence lowvelocity hα emission spectrum taken late nebular phase since portion companion envelope becomes entrained ejecta hydrogen never detected rarely sought present result campaign obtain deep nebularphase spectroscopy nearby type ia supernova include multiepoch observation two event sn slightly subluminous sn cf normally bright hα emission detected spectrum either object upper limit solar abundance material ejecta established model mattila et al coupled massstripping simulation marietta et al meng et al effectively rule progenitor system supernova secondary close enough white dwarf experiencing roche lobe overflow time explosion alternative explanation absence hα emission along suggestion future investigation necessary confidently exclude possibility critically evaluated

This is an inherently chaotic environment with variable accretion, both in terms of rate and the angular momentum of the material, and dynamical interactions between stars. We find that the final stellar rotation axis and disc spin axis can be strongly misaligned, but this occurs primarily when the disc is truncated by a dynamical encounter so that the final disc rotation axis depends simply on what fell in last. This may lead to planetary systems with orbits that are misaligned with the stellar rotation axis, but only if the final disc contains enough mass to form planets. We also investigate the time variability of the inner-disc spin axis, which is likely to determine the direction of a protostellar jet. We find that the jet direction varies more strongly for lighter discs, such as those that have been truncated by dynamical interactions or have suffered a period of rapid accretion. Finally, we note that variability of the angular momentum of the material accreted by a star implies that the internal velocity field of such stars may be more complicated than that of aligned differential rotation.",Physics,4,0,investigate evolution relative angle stellar rotation axis circumstellar disc axis star form stellar cluster collapse turbulent molecular cloud inherently chaotic environment variable accretion term rate angular momentum material dynamical interaction star find final stellar rotation axis disc spin axis strongly misaligned occurs primarily disc truncated dynamical encounter final disc rotation axis depends simply fell last may lead planetary system orbit misaligned stellar rotation axis final disc contains enough mass form planet also investigate time variability innerdisc spin axis likely determine direction protostellar jet find jet direction varies strongly lighter disc truncated dynamical interaction suffered period rapid accretion finally note variability angular momentum material accreted star implies internal velocity field star may complicated aligned differential rotation

Like the handful of other small exoplanets for which transmission spectroscopy has been obtained, GJ 3470b exhibits a flat spectrum in the near- and mid-infrared. Recently, a tentative detection of Rayleigh scattering in its atmosphere has been reported. This signal manifests itself as an observed increase of the planetary radius as a function of decreasing wavelength in the visible. We set out to verify this detection and observed several transits of this planet with the LCOGT network and the Kuiper telescope in four different bands (Sloan g, Sloan i, Harris B, and Harris V). Our analysis reveals a strong Rayleigh scattering slope, thus confirming previous results. This makes GJ 3470b the smallest known exoplanet with a detection of Rayleigh scattering. We find that the most plausible scenario is a hydrogen/helium-dominated atmosphere covered by clouds which obscure absorption features in the infrared and hazes which give rise to scattering in the visible.

They cannot, however, be used for superluminal signaling. It is also known that it is possible to write down sets of 'superquantum' correlations that are more nonlocal than is allowed by quantum mechanics, yet are still nonsignaling. Viewed as an information-theoretic resource, superquantum correlations are very powerful at reducing the amount of communication needed for distributed computational tasks. An intriguing question is why quantum mechanics does not allow these more powerful correlations. We aim to shed light on the range of quantum possibilities by placing them within a wider context. With this in mind, we investigate the set of correlations that are constrained only by the no-signaling principle. These correlations form a polytope, which contains the quantum correlations as a (proper) subset. We determine the vertices of the no-signaling polytope in the case that two observers each choose from two possible measurements with d outcomes. We then consider how interconversions between different sorts of correlations may be achieved. Finally, we consider some multipartite examples.",Physics,2,0,well known measurement performed spatially separated entangled quantum system give rise correlation nonlocal sense bell inequality violated however used superluminal signaling also known possible write set superquantum correlation nonlocal allowed quantum mechanic yet still nonsignaling viewed informationtheoretic resource superquantum correlation powerful reducing amount communication needed distributed computational task intriguing question quantum mechanic allow powerful correlation aim shed light range quantum possibility placing within wider context mind investigate set correlation constrained nosignaling principle correlation form polytope contains quantum correlation proper subset determine vertex nosignaling polytope case two observer choose two possible measurement outcome consider interconversions different sort correlation may achieved finally consider multipartite example

The gas cushions the initial contact; it is entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the so-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid.

The great disadvantage, from our point of view, is that with n=4 (see Table I), we would be forced to start with an even higher symmetry group, namely W4 (or SW4) which when broken would lead to U4 (or SU4) rather than to the thus-far-successful Us (or SUs) group. We consider it preferable to hold the ""baryon-lepton"" principle in abeyance at this stage and to seek experimental evidence for broken Ws (or SWs) among the ha, drons. Finally, we note that there is no very strong reason for restricting oneself to a four-fermion nonlinear interaction model.

Another relationship between H-beta flux and nebular density is examined. The point at which the nebulae become optically thin is seen as a change in the slope of this curve.

The CoRoT space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12 000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search for transiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007. Deep transit signals can be detected quickly in the “alarm-mode” in parallel to the ongoing target field monitoring. CoRoT’s first planets have been detected in this mode. Methods. The CoRoT raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals, outliers, and low-frequency stellar signals. The phase folded lightcurve is used to fit the transit signal and derive the main planetary parameters. Radial velocity follow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive the planet mass. Results. We report the detection of CoRoT-5b, detected during observations of the LRa01 field, the first long-duration field in the galactic anticenter direction.

In contrast to the usual freeze-out scenario, frozen-in FIMP DM interacts very weakly with the particles in the visible sector and never attained thermal equilibrium with the baryon–photon fluid in the early Universe. Instead of being determined by its annihilation strength, the DM abundance depends on the decay and annihilation strengths of particles in equilibrium with the baryon–photon fluid, as well as couplings in the DM sector. This makes frozen-in DM very difficult but not impossible to test. In this review, we present the freeze-in mechanism and its variations considered in the literature (dark freeze-out and reannihilation), compare them to the standard DM freeze-out scenario, discuss several aspects of model building, and pay particular attention to observational properties and general testability o...",Physics,4,0,present overview scenario observed dark matter dm abundance consists feebly interacting massive particle fimps produced nonthermally socalled freezein mechanism contrast usual freezeout scenario frozenin fimp dm interacts weakly particle visible sector never attained thermal equilibrium baryonphoton fluid early universe instead determined annihilation strength dm abundance depends decay annihilation strength particle equilibrium baryonphoton fluid well coupling dm sector make frozenin dm difficult impossible test review present freezein mechanism variation considered literature dark freezeout reannihilation compare standard dm freezeout scenario discus several aspect model building pay particular attention observational property general testability

A unified theory of CGI and CGD through turbulence with the multi-Gaussian shaped incoherent source is developed, and numerical examples are given to see clearly the effects of the system parameters to CGI and CGD. Our results show that the atmospheric effect to the CGI and CGD system is closely related to the propagation distance between the source and the object.

We identify a limit in which the entire string dynamics is described by a minimally coupled (supersymmetric) gauge theory on a noncommutative space, and discuss the corrections away from this limit. Our analysis leads us to an equivalence between ordinary gauge fields and noncommutative gauge fields, which is realized by a change of variables that can be described explicitly. This change of variables is checked by comparing the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld theory with its noncommutative counterpart. We obtain a new perspective on noncommutative gauge theory on a torus, its T-duality, and Morita equivalence.

The first and most restrictive sum rule of the hierarchy yields measure theory in the Kolmogorov sense, which is appropriate physically for the description of stochastic processes such as Brownian motion.

The fact that quantum probabilities can be expressed ""as the squares of quantum amplitudes"" is thus derived in a natural manner, and a series of natural generalizations of the quantum formalism is delineated. Conversely, the mathematical sense in which classical physics is a special case of quantum physics is clarified.

This flattening of the dark matter profile can occur in the most luminous subhalos around Milky Way mass galaxies. Zolotov et al. have suggested a correction to be applied to the central masses of dark matter-only satellites in order to mimic the affect of (1) the flattening of the dark matter cusp due to supernova feedback in luminous satellites and (2) enhanced tidal stripping due to the presence of a baryonic disk. In this paper, we apply this correction to the z = 0 subhalo masses from the high resolution, dark matter-only Via Lactea II (VL2) simulation, and find that the number of massive subhalos is dramatically reduced. After adopting a stellar mass to halo mass relationship for the VL2 halos, and identifying subhalos that are (1) likely to be destroyed by stripping and (2) likely to have star formation suppressed by photo-heating, we find that the number of massive, luminous satellites around a Milky Way mass galaxy is in agreement with the number of observed satellites around the Milky Way or M31.

 We present a new cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation for galaxy formation: TNG50, the third and final instalment of the IllustrisTNG project. TNG50 evolves 2 × 21603 dark matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of $8.5\times 10^4\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ and an average cell size of 70–140 pc in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples ∼700 (6500) galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{10} \, (10^8)\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ at $z$ = 1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 ≲ $z$ ≲ 6). We quantify their sizes, disc heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational versus dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by $\rm H\,\alpha$ light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with ≲300-pc disc heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disc-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of $10^{9-11.5}\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported discs for most cosmic epochs (Vrot/σ > 2–3, $z$ ≲ 5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs ($z$ ≳ 1.5).

The postdisruption evolution is followed until hydrodynamic forces becomes negligible and the liberated gas becomes ballistic. Also given is the rate at which bound mass returns to pericenter after orbiting the hole once. The processes that determine the time scale to circularize the debris orbits and allow an accretion torus to form are discussed. This time scale and the time scales for radiative cooling and accretion inflow determine the onset and duration of the subsequent flare in the AGN luminosity. 22 refs.,Physics,3,0,result reported threedimensional numerical calculation tidal disruption lowmass mainsequence star parabolic orbit around massive black hole mh th stellar mass postdisruption evolution followed hydrodynamic force becomes negligible liberated gas becomes ballistic also given rate bound mass return pericenter orbiting hole process determine time scale circularize debris orbit allow accretion torus form discussed time scale time scale radiative cooling accretion inflow determine onset duration subsequent flare agn luminosity ref

In this regime the scalar field mimics the dynamics of a phantom field and vice versa.

The definition of normal includes all O stars that fit into the standard two-dimensional spectral classification framework and all later type stars that do not exhibit optical emission lines. The upper luminosity limit observed for this sample agrees with previous estimates and indicates that only stars initially less massive than about 40 solar masses evolve to the red supergiant region. Between luminosities of M(bol) = -8.l5 and M(bol) = -6.0, a discontinuity is found in the density distribution of stars in the region of the blue supergiants. On the hotter side of a line, the density of stars is over five times greater than on the cooler side. This feature is identified with an evolutionary time scale change occurring during the core helium-burning phase of the evolution of intermediate mass stars. It is suggested that this feature is best reproduced by stellar evolution models which contain blue loops. 64 refs.",Physics,5,0,hr diagram large magellanic cloud produced using sample normal spectral class g supergiant definition normal includes star fit standard twodimensional spectral classification framework later type star exhibit optical emission line upper luminosity limit observed sample agrees previous estimate indicates star initially le massive solar mass evolve red supergiant region luminosity mbol l mbol discontinuity found density distribution star region blue supergiant hotter side line density star five time greater cooler side feature identified evolutionary time scale change occurring core heliumburning phase evolution intermediate mass star suggested feature best reproduced stellar evolution model contain blue loop ref

This ensemble may be taken as the statistical. This enables an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics with which is associated that classical picture. Such a formulation leads, however, if developed straightforwardly according to the picture, to a theoretical scheme quite different from that of ordinary quantum mechanics. concerning the problems other than the equation of motion. Furthermore, this formulation is not applicable to Fermions when spin, or exclusion principle is taken jrlto account. Bohm's recent renewed form of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics referring to this formulation is criticized in several points. On this formulation we can construct a singular ensemble which is shown to correspond to the tranformation kernel of the wave function to infinitesimally later instant, and thus a connection between this formulation and that of Feyninan's is taken out.

In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted.",Physics,3,0,method following fragmentation simulation time using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph presented normal sph simulation collapse fragmentation molecular cloud highdensity region gas form protostars represented many particle small separation highdensity region require small time step limiting time simulation followed thus end result fragmentation never definitively ascertained comparison cloud fragmentation calculation observed characteristic stellar system made paper highdensity region replaced single nongaseous particle appropriate boundary condition contains mass region accretes infalling mass enables evolution cloud resulting protostars followed many orbit original cloud mass accreted

Both inside and outside the drop, the Reynolds number is taken to be large enough for boundary-layer theory to hold, but small enough for surface tension to keep the drop nearly spherical. Surface-active impurities are assumed absent.

The boundary layers are shown to perturb the velocity field only slightly at high Reynolds numbers, and to obey linear equations which are used to find first and second approximations to the drag coefficient and the rate of internal circulation.

Several dark photon dark matter production mechanisms proposed previously are known to have limitations, at least in certain mass regimes of experimental interest. In this paper, we explore a novel mechanism, where a coherently oscillating axionlike field can efficiently transfer its energy density to a dark photon field via a tachyonic instability. The residual axion relic is subsequently depleted via couplings to the visible sector, leaving only the dark photon as dark matter. We ensure that the cosmologies of both the axion and dark photon are consistent with existing constraints. We find that the mechanism works for a broad range of dark photon masses, including those of interest for ongoing experiments and proposed detection techniques.",Physics,5,0,despite growing interest extensive effort search ultralight dark matter form hypothetical dark photon fit consistent cosmology unclear several dark photon dark matter production mechanism proposed previously known limitation least certain mass regime experimental interest paper explore novel mechanism coherently oscillating axionlike field efficiently transfer energy density dark photon field via tachyonic instability residual axion relic subsequently depleted via coupling visible sector leaving dark photon dark matter ensure cosmology axion dark photon consistent existing constraint find mechanism work broad range dark photon mass including interest ongoing experiment proposed detection technique

1352,82c58d2ffd8da13f2618e03e4ad88c3169644323,Capture of Trojans by a Growing Proto-Jupiter,"Abstract We have studied the capture of planetesimals in Trojan orbits by a growing proto-Jupiter by integrating numerically the equations of motion of planetesimals in a four-body problem Sun–Jupiter–Saturn–planetesimal. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn increase exponentially with time. Nebular gas drag on small planetesimals is taken into account. We show that a fraction of the planetesimals near Jupiter's orbit and almost all planetesimals originally in horseshoe orbits are trapped into stable Trojan orbits. This mechanism was probably an important factor together with collisional diffusion, for delivering a large amount of planetesimals into Trojan orbits during the final growth of Jupiter by gas in-fall. We find also that the libration amplitude of trapped Trojans is damped by the increase of Jupiter's mass reinforcing the stability of the resonance lock. For planetesimals small enough to be perturbed by nebular gas drag, we find an asymmetry between the trapping rate in L5 compared to L4. Peale (1993, Icarus 106, 308–322) noted also that the stability of the L4 resonant region is reduced in presence of an intense frictional drag. We present here a simple semi-analytical explanation for the trapping asymmetry based on the evolution of the angular difference between the planetesimal's and proto-Jupiter's longitude of perihelion. The asymmetry between L4 and L5 could have led to the capture of a larger number of small planetesimals in L5. This may have favored a higher degree of collisional activity in L5 and might explain an alleged asymmetry in the size distribution of the two swarms.",Physics,5,0,abstract studied capture planetesimal trojan orbit growing protojupiter integrating numerically equation motion planetesimal fourbody problem sunjupitersaturnplanetesimal mass jupiter saturn increase exponentially time nebular gas drag small planetesimal taken account show fraction planetesimal near jupiter orbit almost planetesimal originally horseshoe orbit trapped stable trojan orbit mechanism probably important factor together collisional diffusion delivering large amount planetesimal trojan orbit final growth jupiter gas infall find also libration amplitude trapped trojan damped increase jupiter mass reinforcing stability resonance lock planetesimal small enough perturbed nebular gas drag find asymmetry trapping rate l compared l peale icarus noted also stability l resonant region reduced presence intense frictional drag present simple semianalytical explanation trapping asymmetry based evolution angular difference planetesimal protojupiters longitude perihelion asymmetry l l could led capture larger number small planetesimal l may favored higher degree collisional activity l might explain alleged asymmetry size distribution two swarm

A variety of observations indicate that it is nonbaryonic and nonrelativistic. One of the preferred candidates for nonbaryonic DM is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that in most models is stable. WIMP self-annihilation can produce cosmic rays, gamma rays, and other particles with signatures that may be detectable. Hints of anomalous cosmic-ray spectra found by recent experiments, such as PAMELA, have motivated interesting interpretations in terms of DM annihilation and/or decay. However, these signatures also have standard astrophysical interpretations, so additional evidence is needed in order to make a case for detection of DM annihilation or decay. Searches by the Fermi-LAT for gamma-ray signals from clumps, nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and galaxy clusters have also been performed, along with measurements of the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic gammaray emission. In addition, Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes like HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS have reported on searches for gamma-ray emission from dwarf galaxies.

We find that adding a gas envelope equivalent to 0.1%-10% of the mass of a solid planet causes the radius to increase 5%-60% above its gas-free value. A planet with a given mass and radius might have substantial water ice content (a so-called ocean planet), or alternatively a large rocky iron core and some H and/or He. For example, a wide variety of compositions can explain the observed radius of GJ 436b, although all models require some H/He. We conclude that the identification of water worlds based on the mass-radius relationship alone is impossible unless a significant gas layer can be ruled out by other means.",Physics,5,0,bulk composition exoplanet commonly inferred average density small planet however average density unique within range composition variation number important planetary parameterswhich difficult impossible constrain measurement aloneproduce planet average density widely varying bulk composition find adding gas envelope equivalent mass solid planet cause radius increase gasfree value planet given mass radius might substantial water ice content socalled ocean planet alternatively large rocky iron core h andor example wide variety composition explain observed radius gj b although model require hhe conclude identification water world based massradius relationship alone impossible unless significant gas layer ruled mean

We show that their spectral statistics is well reproduced by random matrix theory.

An exact trace formula for the quantum spectrum is developed and used to investigate the origin of the connection between random matrix theory and the underlying chaotic classical dynamics. Being an exact theory, and due to its relative simplicity, it offers new insights into this problem which is at the forefront of the research in quantum chaos and related fields.

Protostars in the vicinity of 30 Doradus,"From a magnitude-limited infrared survey of the 30 Doradus complex four candidate protostars have been identified. These are associated with dense knots in the nebular arcs, and have luminosities of 1-5 × 10 4 L ⊙ and masses of 15-20 M ⊙ . The results indicate that both the knots and the associated star formation are likely to be caused by the compression of interacting arcs of mass-loss winds from hot massive stars in the central cluster, and other nearby clusters.

Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations, we have now detected nebular O VI emission from NGC 6543.

We modeled the O VI emission incorporating thermal conduction but find that simplistic assumptions for the asymptotic giant branch and fast wind mass-loss rates overproduce X-ray emission and O VI emission.

Some of these planets might be transiting their parent star. We present here a detailed study of the atmospheric signatures of transiting Earth-size exoplanets. We focus on a limited number of significant examples, for which we discuss the detectability of some of the possible molecules present in their atmospheres, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O-3), or molecular oxygen (O-2). To this purpose, we developed a model to simulate transmission spectra of Earth-size exoplanets from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near infrared (NIR). According to our calculations, the signatures of planetary atmospheres represent an absorption of a few parts-per-million (ppm) in the stellar flux. The atmospheres of a few Earth-like planets can be detected with a 30-40 m telescope. The detection of the extensive atmospheres of tens of small satellites of giant exoplanets and hundreds of hypothetical ocean-planets can be achieved with 20-30 m and 10-20 m instruments, respectively, provided all these planets are frequent and they are efficiently surveyed.

It raises several issues, all of them relevant. I shall concentrate on two of them, in my view the most important ones. The first issue concerns the character and epistemological location of the critical theory I propose in the book. According to Darian-Smith, my position, which I call oppositional postmodernism, is not sufficiently spelled out. The second issue concerns the conceptualization of globalization and the hierarchies of the world system. According to my reviewer, I accept all too acritically such modernist dichotomies as global/local, core/periphery, and North/South, thereby indicating my “deeper ideological and moral leanings” (Darian-Smith 1998, 115) at the cost of coherence and consistency with my epistemological concerns laid out in the first part of the book. Rather than responding intra-textually to these criticisms-that is to say, rather than resorting to passages in my book where Darian-Smith‘s criticisms may be said to be partially preempted, an easy strategy in the case of such a lengthy book-in this comment I will develop my position on the two issues I have singled out and let the reader grasp the project I undertake in the book and the direction of my current thinking.",Political Science,5,0,eve dariansmiths review book excellent engaging thoughtful provocative essay happy provided pretext raise several issue relevant shall concentrate two view important one first issue concern character epistemological location critical theory propose book according dariansmith position call oppositional postmodernism sufficiently spelled second issue concern conceptualization globalization hierarchy world system according reviewer accept acritically modernist dichotomy globallocal coreperiphery northsouth thereby indicating deeper ideological moral leaning dariansmith cost coherence consistency epistemological concern laid first part book rather responding intratextually criticismsthat say rather resorting passage book dariansmiths criticism may said partially preempted easy strategy case lengthy bookin comment develop position two issue singled let reader grasp project undertake book direction current thinking

From this developed a history of reactive employer involvement within the arbitration sys tem. By linking association formation with the introduction of a unique system of compulsory arbitration, Plowman saw formal employer combination in Australia as exceptional as well as reactionary. This paper challenges the reactivity thesis by subjecting a number of Plowman's key assumptions to historiographic and comparative scrutiny. First. permanent associations, whether organized on a trade, industry or state basis. existed before the advent of arbitration. Second, the increase in employer association formation and activity that occurred around the turn of the century can only partly be attributed to the introduction of compulsory arbitration. Finally, the development of employer associations in Australia showed striking similarities with that of other countries in terms of both periodization and impetus for formation.",Political Science,5,0,developing dominant theory australian employer association david plowman consistently argued australian employer developed permanent association response introduction compulsory arbitration developed history reactive employer involvement within arbitration sys tem linking association formation introduction unique system compulsory arbitration plowman saw formal employer combination australia exceptional well reactionary paper challenge reactivity thesis subjecting number plowman key assumption historiographic comparative scrutiny first permanent association whether organized trade industry state basis existed advent arbitration second increase employer association formation activity occurred around turn century partly attributed introduction compulsory arbitration finally development employer association australia showed striking similarity country term periodization impetus formation

These bylaws, which are largely a Delaware phenomenon, require that derivative actions, stockholder class actions, and other intracorporate disputes be litigated exclusively in designated courts. This article examines the increase in the adoption of such bylaws following a June 2013 Delaware Court of Chancery decision upholding their validity. It also examines the language companies are including in such bylaws, their enforceability in litigation and adoption considerations.",Political Science,5,0,response rising tide strike suit challenging merger acquisition adequacy executive compensation disclosure company adopting considering adopting exclusive forum bylaw bylaw largely delaware phenomenon require derivative action stockholder class action intracorporate dispute litigated exclusively designated court article examines increase adoption bylaw following june delaware court chancery decision upholding validity also examines language company including bylaw enforceability litigation adoption consideration
1445,72e1a0ecef034268114c82bf0a595ae23dbb0712,Lusophone Africa: Beyond Independence,"Even the most committed “lusophiles” will find themselves edified following an engagement with Fernando Arenas’s Lusophone Africa: Beyond Independence. This sweeping account of lusophone Africa, examined via analyses of musical, filmic, and literary expression, showcases Arenas’s profound knowledge of these spaces, both as asymmetrical, independent nations and as a postcolonial collective. In fact, Arenas is keenly interested in the ways that the five countries that comprise lusophone Africa “have been shaped by the myriad phenomena associated with postcolonialism and globalization” (xv). This focus necessitates a nuanced assessment of not only the specificities of the Portuguese colonial experience, but also the ways that contemporary lusophone Africans interact with, and are shaped by, the (former) metropole, the Southern Atlantic lusophone behemoth, Brazil, nonlusophone Africa, and, given the analytical attention granted to globalization, the Global North. The book is at its best when Arenas is deftly weighing and weaving together this seemingly dizzying array of local, regional, and global influences on forms of cultural expression to illustrate how lusophone African artists, artisans, and, by extension, the citizens of the constituent nations, have experienced, and continue to experience, independence. Beyond offering a creative, novel amalgamation of lusophone African music, cinema, and literature to more seasoned consumers of cultural expression and analysis, the book will expose many other readers to these topics for the first time. Only a polyglot such as Arenas, who embeds his English translations of Portuguese, Cape Verdean Kriolu, and Bissau-Guinean Kriol into the text, would be capable of effectively introducing these subjects to anglophone audiences. Indeed, the breadth of songs, music, and written materials originally crafted in these languages that Arenas has accessed, coupled with analyses that are informed by a",Political Science,5,0,even committed lusophiles find edified following engagement fernando arena lusophone africa beyond independence sweeping account lusophone africa examined via analysis musical filmic literary expression showcase arena profound knowledge space asymmetrical independent nation postcolonial collective fact arena keenly interested way five country comprise lusophone africa shaped myriad phenomenon associated postcolonialism globalization xv focus necessitates nuanced assessment specificity portuguese colonial experience also way contemporary lusophone african interact shaped former metropole southern atlantic lusophone behemoth brazil nonlusophone africa given analytical attention granted globalization global north book best arena deftly weighing weaving together seemingly dizzying array local regional global influence form cultural expression illustrate lusophone african artist artisan extension citizen constituent nation experienced continue experience independence beyond offering creative novel amalgamation lusophone african music cinema literature seasoned consumer cultural expression analysis book expose many reader topic first time polyglot arena embeds english translation portuguese cape verdean kriolu bissauguinean kriol text would capable effectively introducing subject anglophone audience indeed breadth song music written material originally crafted language arena accessed coupled analysis informed

Chapter one discusses how historians of science have usually placed Ptolemy among Aristotle's followers. It emphasizes that, while Ptolemy's theories about physics and mathematics had similarities with those of other Hellenic scientists, over-all his ideas were distinctive. Chapter two follows this theme in more detail, looking at the ideas in the philosophical preface to Syntaxis Mathematike (or Almagest), Ptolemy's most famous work. Here we learn that while Aristotle says that theology is the most important science, Ptolemy gives that honor to mathematics (pp. 26, 29). ""Mathematics is the surest road to that which divine and eternal,"" (p. 29) and to study mathematics can make one virtuous and beautiful (p. 31).

1464,a11afdf344a89e50b02d37f25a9036ded781b0aa,Oppositional Postmodernism and Globalizations,"Eve Darian-Smith’s review of my book is an excellent, engaging, thoughtful, and provocative essay, and I am happy for having provided the pretext for it. It raises several issues, all of them relevant. I shall concentrate on two of them, in my view the most important ones. The first issue concerns the character and epistemological location of the critical theory I propose in the book. According to Darian-Smith, my position, which I call oppositional postmodernism, is not sufficiently spelled out. The second issue concerns the conceptualization of globalization and the hierarchies of the world system. According to my reviewer, I accept all too acritically such modernist dichotomies as global/local, core/periphery, and North/South, thereby indicating my “deeper ideological and moral leanings” (Darian-Smith 1998, 115) at the cost of coherence and consistency with my epistemological concerns laid out in the first part of the book. Rather than responding intra-textually to these criticisms-that is to say, rather than resorting to passages in my book where Darian-Smith‘s criticisms may be said to be partially preempted, an easy strategy in the case of such a lengthy book-in this comment I will develop my position on the two issues I have singled out and let the reader grasp the project I undertake in the book and the direction of my current thinking.",Political Science,5,0,eve dariansmiths review book excellent engaging thoughtful provocative essay happy provided pretext raise several issue relevant shall concentrate two view important one first issue concern character epistemological location critical theory propose book according dariansmith position call oppositional postmodernism sufficiently spelled second issue concern conceptualization globalization hierarchy world system according reviewer accept acritically modernist dichotomy globallocal coreperiphery northsouth thereby indicating deeper ideological moral leaning dariansmith cost coherence consistency epistemological concern laid first part book rather responding intratextually criticismsthat say rather resorting passage book dariansmiths criticism may said partially preempted easy strategy case lengthy bookin comment develop position two issue singled let reader grasp project undertake book direction current thinking

Second, how pervasive is EG in the EU when compared to alternative forms of governance? Third, what is the effect of EG on EU policy outcomes, on the one hand, and the overall architecture of the EU, on the other?

Politics has become deeply judicialised and the judiciary has become profoundly involved in issues which used to be the sole domain of ‘pure’ politics. Some talk of ‘the secular papacy’, ie the judiciary of the Modern West playing the role of the 12 century papacy of the Medieval Western World. Others criticise the rise of ‘juristocracy’ and the decline of popular politics.Thus, it is not surprising that the phenomenon of ‘New Constitutionalism’ started to infl uence the emerging constitutionalisation of the European Communities in the 1960s and 1970s. A specifi c regime of European ‘constitutional tolerance’ involves constitutional and methodological pluralism among the Union and its Members, including the plurality of views on what is, and whether there is any, Grundnorm of the legal system, or who is the fi nal arbiter of European Constitutionalism.

The scope of such a denunciation and the consequences relating to it were central in these debates. Starting with the analysis of the mechanism precisely set out in the Convention, this article, focusing only on the implication for non-contractual arbitration, aims at clearly establishing the meaning of consent to ICSID arbitration, one of the conditions preventing the denunciation of the Convention from having a full effect. The question thus becomes whether BITs and national laws could be considered as unilateral consent to arbitration, as understood by the drafters of the Convention.

Prosecutors have unlimited discretion not to charge, and when they do proceed, they have largely unlimited power to determine which charges to file.1 After filing, prosecutors have virtually unlimited discretion to determine whether to offer a plea agreement. The determination of guilt by trial is tightly structured, but after conviction, the judge typically has uncontrolled discretion to select a sentence from an enormously wide range.2 That such discretion can lead, and has led, to disparate treatment of offenders, to abuse of authority, and to numerous related inequities has not escaped notice and has been the subject of extensive commentary. The precise extent of injustice and the feasibility of reform remain subjects of lively debate.

Chapter one discusses how historians of science have usually placed Ptolemy among Aristotle's followers. It emphasizes that, while Ptolemy's theories about physics and mathematics had similarities with those of other Hellenic scientists, over-all his ideas were distinctive. Chapter two follows this theme in more detail, looking at the ideas in the philosophical preface to Syntaxis Mathematike (or Almagest), Ptolemy's most famous work. Here we learn that while Aristotle says that theology is the most important science, Ptolemy gives that honor to mathematics (pp. 26, 29). ""Mathematics is the surest road to that which divine and eternal,"" (p. 29) and to study mathematics can make one virtuous and beautiful (p. 31). This last statement is evidence of Plato's influence, Taub believes.",Political Science,3,0,introduction outline work chapter one discus historian science usually placed ptolemy among aristotle follower emphasizes ptolemy theory physic mathematics similarity hellenic scientist overall idea distinctive chapter two follows theme detail looking idea philosophical preface syntaxis mathematike almagest ptolemy famous work learn aristotle say theology important science ptolemy give honor mathematics pp mathematics surest road divine eternal p study mathematics make one virtuous beautiful p last statement evidence plato influence taub belief

Generally speaking, books on cinema written by professors in university film departments are brushed lightly aside by those critics who haunt film festivals and write extensively on directors of choice. And since many of these university editions stem from an in-depth analysis of videotapes and DVDs supplied for classroom courses and film seminars, they are overlooked by the film historian as being a trifle ”academic” meaning: tedious, partial, pedantic, even dogmatic. By the same token, the research academician specializing in the sociology, psychology, and semantics of the cinema tend to dismiss ”over the top” eulogies by the film critics whose so-called expertise stems from a portfolio of interviews with favourite directors, while paying little attention to the sociopolitical context from which certain key films were formed.",Political Science,1,0,dina iordanovas cinema europe book film scholar shelf ready reference generally speaking book cinema written professor university film department brushed lightly aside critic haunt film festival write extensively director choice since many university edition stem indepth analysis videotape dvd supplied classroom course film seminar overlooked film historian trifle academic meaning tedious partial pedantic even dogmatic token research academician specializing sociology psychology semantics cinema tend dismiss top eulogy film critic whose socalled expertise stem portfolio interview favourite director paying little attention sociopolitical context certain key film formed

Perilaku keuangan investor di pasar modal terdiri dari behavioral finance dan investasi tradisional. Behavioral Finance merupakan perilaku keuangan menggunakan rule of thumb dalam mengamati data atau informasi yang tersedia. Banyak bias yang terjadi dari keputusan yang diambil, oleh karena bingkai dan bentuk informasi yang diperoleh sesuai dengan keinginan dan pemahaman dari investor itu sendiri. Para investor yang memiliki pemahaman pasar itu tidak efisien, pelaku atau orang di dalamnya memiliki perilaku yang irrasional, dan harga saham naik turun dalam jangka pendek. Sebagian lagi dari praktisi keuangan memiliki pemahaman yang berbeda, yaitu investasi tradisional, dimana semua investor dapat menggunakan informasi serta alat statistik dengan benar dan semestinya.

The scope of such a denunciation and the consequences relating to it were central in these debates. Starting with the analysis of the mechanism precisely set out in the Convention, this article, focusing only on the implication for non-contractual arbitration, aims at clearly establishing the meaning of consent to ICSID arbitration, one of the conditions preventing the denunciation of the Convention from having a full effect. The question thus becomes whether BITs and national laws could be considered as unilateral consent to arbitration, as understood by the drafters of the Convention. Applying concrete and correct treaty interpretation rules will enable us to establish an accurate understanding of the relevant provisions of the Convention, without depriving them of their proper meaning.",Political Science,4,0,possibility denouncing icsid convention recently sparked doctrinal controversy scope denunciation consequence relating central debate starting analysis mechanism precisely set convention article focusing implication noncontractual arbitration aim clearly establishing meaning consent icsid arbitration one condition preventing denunciation convention full effect question thus becomes whether bit national law could considered unilateral consent arbitration understood drafter convention applying concrete correct treaty interpretation rule enable u establish accurate understanding relevant provision convention without depriving proper meaning

Prosecutors have unlimited discretion not to charge, and when they do proceed, they have largely unlimited power to determine which charges to file.1 After filing, prosecutors have virtually unlimited discretion to determine whether to offer a plea agreement. The determination of guilt by trial is tightly structured, but after conviction, the judge typically has uncontrolled discretion to select a sentence from an enormously wide range.2 That such discretion can lead, and has led, to disparate treatment of offenders, to abuse of authority, and to numerous related inequities has not escaped notice and has been the subject of extensive commentary. The precise extent of injustice and the feasibility of reform remain subjects of lively debate.

Would God be unjust if He failed to punish and reward? And what is it about good or evil actions and moral identity that might generate such necessities? These were some of the vital religious and philosophical questions that eighth- and ninth-century Mu'tazilite theologians and their sophisticated successors attempted to answer, giving rise to a distinctive ethical position and one of the most prominent and controversial intellectual trends in medieval Islam. The Mu'tazilites developed a view of ethics whose distinguishing features were its austere moral objectivism and the crucial role it assigned to reason in the knowledge of moral truths. Central to this ethical vision was the notion of moral desert, and of the good and evil consequences--reward or punishment--deserved through a person's acts. Moral Agents and Their Deserts is the first book-length study of this central theme in Mu'tazilite ethics, and an attempt to grapple with the philosophical questions it raises. At the same time, it is a bid to question the ways in which modern readers, coming to medieval Islamic thought with a philosophical interest, seek to read and converse with Mu'tazilite theology. Moral Agents and Their Deserts tracks the challenges and rewards involved in the pursuit of the right conversation at the seams between modern and medieval concerns.",Political Science,5,0,must good deed rewarded wrongdoer punished would god unjust failed punish reward good evil action moral identity might generate necessity vital religious philosophical question eighth ninthcentury mutazilite theologian sophisticated successor attempted answer giving rise distinctive ethical position one prominent controversial intellectual trend medieval islam mutazilites developed view ethic whose distinguishing feature austere moral objectivism crucial role assigned reason knowledge moral truth central ethical vision notion moral desert good evil consequencesreward punishmentdeserved person act moral agent desert first booklength study central theme mutazilite ethic attempt grapple philosophical question raise time bid question way modern reader coming medieval islamic thought philosophical interest seek read converse mutazilite theology moral agent desert track challenge reward involved pursuit right conversation seam modern medieval concern

In particular, the roles played by the envious party's social comparison with, and ill will against, the better off are emphasised. The ill will component is characterised by the envier's ultimate goal or wish that the envied suffer some harm, and is distinguished from resentment and sense of injustice, which have often been considered part of envy. The reprehensible nature of envy is discussed, and traced back to the analysis of its components. Finally, we explore both points of overlap and distinguishing features between envy and other emotions such as jealousy or emulation, and make a few general remarks, pointing to the necessity of overcoming conceptual looseness in the notion of envy.",Psychology,3,0,work provides analysis basic cognitive component envy particular role played envious party social comparison ill better emphasised ill component characterised enviers ultimate goal wish envied suffer harm distinguished resentment sense injustice often considered part envy reprehensible nature envy discussed traced back analysis component finally explore point overlap distinguishing feature envy emotion jealousy emulation make general remark pointing necessity overcoming conceptual looseness notion envy

Resisting the conventional wisdom that says that if the mind is a large neural network it cannot simultaneously be a manipulator of symbols, Marcus outlines a variety of ways in which neural systems could be organized so as to manipulate symbols, and he shows why such systems are more likely to provide an adequate substrate for language and cognition than neural systems that are inconsistent with the manipulation of symbols. Concluding with a discussion of how a neurally realized system of symbol-manipulation could have evolved and how such a system could unfold developmentally within the womb, Marcus helps to set the future agenda of cognitive neuroscience.",Psychology,3,0,algebraic mind gary marcus attempt integrate two theory mind work one say mind computerlike manipulator symbol another say mind large network neuron working together parallel resisting conventional wisdom say mind large neural network simultaneously manipulator symbol marcus outline variety way neural system could organized manipulate symbol show system likely provide adequate substrate language cognition neural system inconsistent manipulation symbol concluding discussion neurally realized system symbolmanipulation could evolved system could unfold developmentally within womb marcus help set future agenda cognitive neuroscience

I defend the hypothesis that this cognitive system explains core aspects of the sense of having a self in agency and perception. In particular, this cognitive model explains the phenomenological notion of a minimal self as well as a notion of the narrative self. The proposal is related to some influential studies of overall brain function, and to psychopathology. These elusive notions of the self are shown to be the natural upshots of general cognitive mechanisms whose fundamental purpose is to enable agents to represent the world and act in it.",Psychology,4,0,phenomenology agency perception probably underpinned common cognitive system based generative model predictive coding defend hypothesis cognitive system explains core aspect sense self agency perception particular cognitive model explains phenomenological notion minimal self well notion narrative self proposal related influential study overall brain function psychopathology elusive notion self shown natural upshot general cognitive mechanism whose fundamental purpose enable agent represent world act

1657,d7c54e0af484ebabb47847a8fadb5f57d3a598b5,Limitations of Language for Conveying Navigational Knowledge: Way-Finding in the Southeastern Solomon Islands,"ABSTRACT  Investigators have tended to view navigation either through the lens of cognition or of experience and embodiment. The cognitive approach assumes that perceptually salient aspects of the environment are mapped and retrieved in the mind (so-called cognitive mapping). The alternative is that navigators “feel” their way by ongoing sensations of movement, assessing their position through the sequential, temporal order in which salient environmental information is perceived. Recently, others have challenged models of knowledge that analytically separate cognitive and experiential modalities of knowing, suggesting that the navigator combines cognitive with visual, auditory, and kinesthetic information into an integrated whole. Such a holistic approach to spatial orientation and way-finding raises an important methodological challenge to cognitive anthropology, as certain forms of knowledge are not easily expressed in words. This is particularly true of kinesthetic knowledge of a canoe's motion, which provides navigators with an indirect assessment of wave patterns. Here, we explore one of the authors’ observations during a voyage with a demonstrably accomplished navigator from the Solomon Islands’ Temotu Province who, nonetheless, appeared to provide inconsistent and self-contradictory accounts of his surroundings and performance.

1659,9833b9d07cc8f8b302008fbbb9ebfb2fa68f8db4,The Game of Humor: A Comprehensive Theory of Why We Laugh,"Humor, wit, and laughter surround each person. From everyday quips to the carefully contrived comedy of literature, newspapers, and television we experience humor in many forms, yet the impetus for our laughter is far from innocuous. Misfortune, stupidity, and moral or cultural defects, however faintly revealed in others and ourselves, seem to make us laugh. Although discomforting, such negative terms as superiority, aggression, hostility, ridicule, or degradation can be applied to instances of humor. According to scholars, Thomas Hobbes's ""superiority theory""--that humor arises from mischances, infirmities, and indecencies, where there is no wit at all--applies to most humor. With the exception of good-natured play, Charles R. Gruner claims that humor is rarely as innocent as it first appears. Gruner's proposed superiority theory of humor is all-encompassing. In The Game of Humor, he expands the scope of Hobbes's theory to include and explore the contest aspect of ""good-natured"" play. As such, the author believes all instances of humor can be examined as games, in terms of competition and keeping score--winners and losers. Gruner draws on a broad spectrum of thought-provoking examples. Holocaust jokes, sexual humor, the racialist dialogue of such comic characters as Stepin Fetchit and Archie Bunker, simple puns, and many of the author's own encounters with everyday humor. Gruner challenges the reader to offer a single example of humor that cannot be ""de-humorized"" by its agonistic nature. The Game of Humor makes intriguing and enjoyable reading for people interested in humor and the aspects of human motivation.

1660,bced25c0822a5c755cae7dabd081aa19148b94be,Mind: A Brief Introduction,"""The philosophy of mind is unique among contemporary philosophical subjects,"" writes John Searle, ""in that all of the most famous and influential theories are false."" In ""Mind"", Searle dismantles these famous and influential theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. Here readers will find one of the world's most eminent thinkers shedding light on the central concern of modern philosophy. Searle begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind-which he calls ""Descartes and Other Disasters""-problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as the freedom of the will, the actual operation of mental causation, the nature and functioning of the unconscious, the analysis of perception, and the concept of the self. One of the key chapters is on the mind-body problem, which Searle analyzes brilliantly. He argues that all forms of consciousness-from feeling thirsty to wondering how to translate Mallarme-are caused by the behavior of neurons and are realized in the brain system, which is itself composed of neurons. But this does not mean that consciousness is nothing but neuronal behavior. The main point of having the concept of consciousness, Searle points out, is to capture the first person subjective features of the phenomenon and this point is lost if we redefine consciousness in third person objective terms. Described as a ""dragonslayer by temperament,"" John Searle offers here a refreshingly direct and open discussion of philosophy, one that skewers accepted wisdom even as it offers striking new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind.",Psychology,4,0,philosophy mind unique among contemporary philosophical subject writes john searle famous influential theory false mind searle dismantles famous influential theory present vividly written comprehensive introduction mind reader find one world eminent thinker shedding light central concern modern philosophy searle begin look twelve problem philosophy mindwhich call descartes disastersproblems return throughout volume illuminates topic freedom actual operation mental causation nature functioning unconscious analysis perception concept self one key chapter mindbody problem searle analyzes brilliantly argues form consciousnessfrom feeling thirsty wondering translate mallarmeare caused behavior neuron realized brain system composed neuron mean consciousness nothing neuronal behavior main point concept consciousness searle point capture first person subjective feature phenomenon point lost redefine consciousness third person objective term described dragonslayer temperament john searle offer refreshingly direct open discussion philosophy one skewer accepted wisdom even offer striking new insight nature consciousness mind

1665,af75d4bc0d700ce5a700199db05cb6c4dc10db59,Humor as Violation and Deprecation: A Cognitive Anthropological Account,"Over the past few centuries, scholars have expressed a number of models of humor which are divergent, but potentially complementary. Specifically, the Incongruity Hypothesis posits that humor is our confrontation with a stimulus that is surprising or inconsistent with the way we normally view the world. The Hermetic Hypothesis maintains that the incongruity of humorous statements or events exploits shared cultural (i.e., schematic) knowledge. The Deprecation Hypothesis suggests that humor involves lowering the status of a target individual, group, or object. This paper tests a number of predictions derived from these approaches using statements that isolate the types of violations in both form (i.e., schematic or ontological template violations) and content (i.e., deprecating or non-deprecating). Using cognitive anthropological approaches to the mind, the present results suggest that the most effective forms of humor are deprecating, schematic violations.",Psychology,4,0,past century scholar expressed number model humor divergent potentially complementary specifically incongruity hypothesis posit humor confrontation stimulus surprising inconsistent way normally view world hermetic hypothesis maintains incongruity humorous statement event exploit shared cultural ie schematic knowledge deprecation hypothesis suggests humor involves lowering status target individual group object paper test number prediction derived approach using statement isolate type violation form ie schematic ontological template violation content ie deprecating nondeprecating using cognitive anthropological approach mind present result suggest effective form humor deprecating schematic violation

Two experiments revealed that, compared to complainants, respondents liked inaction and disliked arbitration. However, the most striking findings concerned general preferences among the procedures: consensual procedures (negotiation, mediation, and advisory‐arbitration) were best liked, followed by arbitration, with inaction and struggle least liked. Further analysis suggested that perceptions of self‐interest and societal norms underlie these procedural preferences, with the latter perceptions apparently more important. An examination of choices among the procedures revealed that negotiation was by far the most common first choice of action. If negotiation failed to resolve the conflict, the following escalative sequence of actions was typically endorsed: mediation, then advisory arbitration, then arbitration, and finally struggle.",Psychology,5,0,research concerned preference choice among six procedure commonly used resolve dispute two experiment revealed compared complainant respondent liked inaction disliked arbitration however striking finding concerned general preference among procedure consensual procedure negotiation mediation advisoryarbitration best liked followed arbitration inaction struggle least liked analysis suggested perception selfinterest societal norm underlie procedural preference latter perception apparently important examination choice among procedure revealed negotiation far common first choice action negotiation failed resolve conflict following escalative sequence action typically endorsed mediation advisory arbitration arbitration finally struggle

Instead, alternative critical strategies are suggested based upon understanding cognitive science as a knowledge-producing practice, investigating how it constructs its object of interest (individuals regarded as akin to computational devices) and revealing the practical means by which it comes to represent that object theoretically. Drawing on recent work in the sociology of science and critical anthropology, it is argued that many of the practices of cognitive science can be addressed in terms of how time is constructed and manipulated. This perspective leads to discussions of a variety of issues, including the nature of experimental practice, the status of the concept of representation in cognitive theory, the relationship between knowledge and power, and the prospects for alternative `reflexive' knowledge forms.",Psychology,4,0,paper build observation sociological phenomenological philosophical critique cognitivism little impact research agenda cognitive science instead alternative critical strategy suggested based upon understanding cognitive science knowledgeproducing practice investigating construct object interest individual regarded akin computational device revealing practical mean come represent object theoretically drawing recent work sociology science critical anthropology argued many practice cognitive science addressed term time constructed manipulated perspective lead discussion variety issue including nature experimental practice status concept representation cognitive theory relationship knowledge power prospect alternative reflexive knowledge form

In this article we develop a visual rhetoric that differentiates the pictorial strategies available to advertisers and links them to consumer response. We propose a new typology that distinguishes nine types of visual rhetorical figures according to their degree of complexity and ambiguity. We then derive empirically testable predictions concerning how these different types of visual figures may influence such consumer responses as elaboration and belief change. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of marrying textual analysis, as found in literary, semiotic and rhetorical disciplines, with the experimental methodology characteristic of social and cognitive psychology.",Psychology,5,0,goal rhetorical theory always organize possibility persuasion within domain relate possible stratagem specific desired outcome article develop visual rhetoric differentiates pictorial strategy available advertiser link consumer response propose new typology distinguishes nine type visual rhetorical figure according degree complexity ambiguity derive empirically testable prediction concerning different type visual figure may influence consumer response elaboration belief change article concludes discussion importance marrying textual analysis found literary semiotic rhetorical discipline experimental methodology characteristic social cognitive psychology
1692,1f01cf55fba7fbcabc9a8f9d2c60aca743204263,Creativity & Madness Revisited from Current Psychological Perspectives,"Both scientific evidence and folklore have suggested that madness is associated with creativity, especially in the arts. Recently, more rigorous studies have confirmed to some extent these previous observations. The current view is that it is not severe and acute insanity that is related to heightened creativity, but the personality roots and soft manifestations of both schizophrenic and bipolar psychoses. The affective and cognitive peculiarities associated with schizotypic and hypomanic personalities may be preferentially related to different kinds of creative endeavours, such as the sciences and arts, respectively. The connection between personality traits and creativity is produced because they share some biological-cognitive-personality features, such as cognitive disinhibition. Additionally, it has been shown that the genetic liability for both bipolar and schizophrenic psychoses is related to creativity. A prevailing hypothesis is that creativity may be one type of 'compensatory advantage' for those carrying the genes for psychosis.

Johnson uses recent research into infant psychology to show how the body generates meaning even before self-consciousness has fully developed. From there he turns to cognitive neuroscience to further explore the bodily origins of meaning, thought, and language and examines the many dimensions of meaning - including images, qualities, emotions, and metaphors - that are all rooted in the body's physical encounters with the world. Drawing on the psychology of art and pragmatist philosophy, Johnson argues that all of these aspects of meaning-making are fundamentally aesthetic. He concludes that the arts are the culmination of human attempts to find meaning and that studying the aesthetic dimensions of our experience is crucial to unlocking meaning's bodily sources.Throughout, Johnson puts forth a bold new conception of the mind rooted in the understanding that philosophy will matter to nonphilosophers only if it is built on a visceral connection to the world.",Psychology,5,0,meaning body mark johnson continues pioneering work exciting connection cognitive science language meaning first begun classic metaphor live johnson us recent research infant psychology show body generates meaning even selfconsciousness fully developed turn cognitive neuroscience explore bodily origin meaning thought language examines many dimension meaning including image quality emotion metaphor rooted body physical encounter world drawing psychology art pragmatist philosophy johnson argues aspect meaningmaking fundamentally aesthetic concludes art culmination human attempt find meaning studying aesthetic dimension experience crucial unlocking meaning bodily sourcesthroughout johnson put forth bold new conception mind rooted understanding philosophy matter nonphilosophers built visceral connection world

Arbitration was the most generally preferred means of settlement, followed in order by the moot, mediation, autocratic, and bargaining procedures. The independent variables modified these preferences, however, such that procedures with a high degree of third-party intervention were preferred more when there was temporal urgency, outcome noncorrespondence, and a standard. Interactions revealed that correspondence affected preferences only when there was no temporal urgency, and presence-absence of a standard affected preferences only when there was temporal urgency and outcome correspondence.",Psychology,2,0,experimental study manipulated presence absence temporal urgency presence absence judgmental standard correspondence noncorrespondence outcome among disputant factorial design ass effect preference five disputeresolution procedure arranged along continuum decreasing thirdparty intervention autocratic decisionmaking arbitration moot mediation bargaining arbitration generally preferred mean settlement followed order moot mediation autocratic bargaining procedure independent variable modified preference however procedure high degree thirdparty intervention preferred temporal urgency outcome noncorrespondence standard interaction revealed correspondence affected preference temporal urgency presenceabsence standard affected preference temporal urgency outcome correspondence

He was the first to identify schizophrenia and manic-depression, and he pioneered the use of drugs to treat mental illness. He was also joint discoverer of Alzheimer's disease - which he named after his collaborator, Dr Alois Alzheimer. Kraepelin presented these and other discoveries in successive editions of his ""Psychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch"" (definitive 8th edition also now available from Thoemmes Press). Much of this gigantic textbook can only be read in the original German; but parts of it were translated into English, and they had a very profound influence on the development of world psychiatry for the rest of the 20th century. ""Manic-Depressive Insanity and Paranoia"" (1921) was the last section of Kraepelin's great German textbook to be translated into English. Published in 1921, the book showed for the first time that psychotic depression could have alternating forms of mania and severe melancholy. In Kraepelin's view both manic-depression and dementia praecox (or ""schizophrenia"") were endogenous psychoses, originating in biological disorder; but he distinguished dementia praecox as deteriorating - that is, as having a very poor prognosis for recovery - from his new category of manic-depression, which was non-deteriorating. Kraepelin's classifications of these disorders have persisted into the 21st century, yet the books in which he first explained them to the English-speaking world have become very hard to find.

1701,d1e9be27661bf563cb4566509e4ae55826cbe180,Cultural psychology: Cultural psychology – what is it?,"A discipline is emerging called “cultural psychology.” It is not general psychology. It is not cross-cultural psychology. It is not psychological anthropology. It is not ethnopsychology. It is cultural psychology. And its time may have arrived, once again. While the authors in this volume were never asked to define or explicitly address the idea of a cultural psychology, several of the chapters turned out to be examples of it. They inspired this essay – which is a preliminary attempt to say, taxonomically and narratively, and briefly – what the discipline of cultural psychology was, is, and ought to be about. Ultimately it is a story of cyclical return. In the short run, however, the essay is a story of one of the pitfalls of the “cognitive revolution” of the 1960s, the failure of the cognitive revolution to develop an adequate theory of the “person,” because of the prevailing Platonism implicit in its scientific agenda. The essay is also a scouting expedition across the boundaries of some very treacherous disciplinary territories in the search to recover an important interdisciplinary identity. Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, transform, and permute the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion. Cultural psychology is the study of the ways subject and object, self and other, psyche and culture, person and context, figure and ground, practitioner and practice live together, require each other, and dynamically, dialectically, and jointly make each other up.",Psychology,4,0,discipline emerging called cultural psychology general psychology crosscultural psychology psychological anthropology ethnopsychology cultural psychology time may arrived author volume never asked define explicitly address idea cultural psychology several chapter turned example inspired essay preliminary attempt say taxonomically narratively briefly discipline cultural psychology ought ultimately story cyclical return short run however essay story one pitfall cognitive revolution failure cognitive revolution develop adequate theory person prevailing platonism implicit scientific agenda essay also scouting expedition across boundary treacherous disciplinary territory search recover important interdisciplinary identity cultural psychology study way cultural tradition social practice regulate express transform permute human psyche resulting le psychic unity humankind ethnic divergence mind self emotion cultural psychology study way subject object self psyche culture person context figure ground practitioner practice live together require dynamically dialectically jointly make

As the English as a lingua franca field of enquiry grows, this article provides needed dialogue, consideration, and reflection over how we conceptualise our subject matter, our roles, and our rhetorical stances. This paper proposes the usefulness of considering the complexity of language, not as something that gets in the way of empiricism or clarity, but as something that makes ELF researchers perfectly positioned to investigate and contribute to wider understandings of language. Complexity theory is drawn upon as a conceptual tool that can be useful in guiding our thinking about the dynamic nature of language, which, in turn, is considered in relation to the reasons why language is complex, namely its roles in relation to practices and contextualisation. Having established our approaches to the complexity of the language in ELF scenarios, we propose implications for ELF researchers' treatment of speakers, language, and ideology.",Psychology,3,0,abstract paper set theoretical approach language guide author research field underrepresented literature english lingua franca field enquiry grows article provides needed dialogue consideration reflection conceptualise subject matter role rhetorical stance paper proposes usefulness considering complexity language something get way empiricism clarity something make elf researcher perfectly positioned investigate contribute wider understanding language complexity theory drawn upon conceptual tool useful guiding thinking dynamic nature language turn considered relation reason language complex namely role relation practice contextualisation established approach complexity language elf scenario propose implication elf researcher treatment speaker language ideology
1704,7a6017e705a251cd1f8bb1bcd52273636629ea65,Speech And Language In Psychoanalysis,"Jacques Lacan's commentaries on Freud had revolutionary implications not only for the analytic movement but also for contemporary philosophy and literary criticism. Lacan held that if the unconscious, as Freud described it, exists, it functions linguistically, rather than symbolically or instinctually. He refers to the unconscious as a language: ""the discourse of the Other."" In The Language of the Self Lacan offers a significant and fertile return to the heart of the Freudian texts. Originally published in paperback under the title Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis, this book is based on Anthony Wilden's translation of ""Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse,"" a 1953 article that became a manifesto for a generation interested in a new reading of Freud.

We therefore defend the view that phenomenal consciousness is exclusively experiential (or nonconceptual) in character. The main focus of the chapter is on the alleged contribution that concepts make to the phenomenology of visual experience. For we take it that if cognitive phenomenology is to be found anywhere, it should be found here. However, we begin with a discussion of the question of cognitive phenomenology more generally, and we close by sketching how our argument might be extended into the domain of non-perceptual thought.",Psychology,2,0,goal chapter mount critique claim cognitive content kind content possessed concept thought make constitutive contribution phenomenal property mental life therefore defend view phenomenal consciousness exclusively experiential nonconceptual character main focus chapter alleged contribution concept make phenomenology visual experience take cognitive phenomenology found anywhere found however begin discussion question cognitive phenomenology generally close sketching argument might extended domain nonperceptual thought

The contested and diverse nature of both constructs makes untangling their connections a complex yet vital task. The purpose of this article is to advance the discussion regarding this intersection by offering a theoretical approach that may serve as a basis for analyzing epistemic thinking and aligning it with current views of metacognition. Based on a synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies, we argue that epistemic thinking is a multifaceted construct with both cognitive and metacognitive aspects. Furthermore, we propose that epistemic metacognition includes several aspects such as metacognitive skills; metacognitive knowledge about persons, strategies and tasks; and metacognitive experiences. The theoretical, methodological, and instructional implications of this approach are explored.",Psychology,5,0,one central unresolved conceptual issue concern researcher personal epistemology characterization intersection personal epistemology metacognition contested diverse nature construct make untangling connection complex yet vital task purpose article advance discussion regarding intersection offering theoretical approach may serve basis analyzing epistemic thinking aligning current view metacognition based synthesis theoretical empirical study argue epistemic thinking multifaceted construct cognitive metacognitive aspect furthermore propose epistemic metacognition includes several aspect metacognitive skill metacognitive knowledge person strategy task metacognitive experience theoretical methodological instructional implication approach explored

Both were the achievements of Wilhelm Wundt, ever since recognized as experimental psychology's great patron, though later barred from any role that might remotely resemble sainthood. Soon after the wave of ""new"" psychologists spread out from Wundt's laboratory, a series of intellectual revolutions largely erased from memory the content of Wundtian psychological theory. Now that the movement set in motion by Wundt has come through its first century, it would seem fitting to mark the centenary by briefly turning back, reexamining psychology's historical foundations, and paying homage to the founding father. There is, however, another reason for review, being less ceremonial and clearly more interesting. To put it simply, the few current Wundt-scholars (and some do exist) are in fair agreement that Wundt as portrayed today in many texts and courses is largely fictional and often bears little resemblance to the actual historical figure (cf. Blumenthal, 1970; Bringmann, Balance, & Evans, 1975; Mischel, 1970). Naturally, it might be suspected that the above radical statement is only the nit-picking of a few antiquarians obsessed with minor matters of interpretation. But alas, such is not the case. These are claims about the very fundamentals of Wundt's work, often asserting the opposite of what has been a standard description prevailing over much of the past century. Yet, if popular historical accounts",Psychology,4,0,approximately year ago era intellectual ferment event marked consequence took place history psychology decade first handbook experimental psychology appeared followed soon founding first formal laboratory experimental psychology achievement wilhelm wundt ever since recognized experimental psychology great patron though later barred role might remotely resemble sainthood soon wave new psychologist spread wundts laboratory series intellectual revolution largely erased memory content wundtian psychological theory movement set motion wundt come first century would seem fitting mark centenary briefly turning back reexamining psychology historical foundation paying homage founding father however another reason review le ceremonial clearly interesting put simply current wundtscholars exist fair agreement wundt portrayed today many text course largely fictional often bear little resemblance actual historical figure cf blumenthal bringmann balance evans mischel naturally might suspected radical statement nitpicking antiquarian obsessed minor matter interpretation ala case claim fundamental wundts work often asserting opposite standard description prevailing much past century yet popular historical account

1723,dee33567d7ea923ec056809799bc0774ef0f684d,An Introduction to Radical Constructivism,"The experiencing consciousness creates structure in the flow of its experience, and that structure is what conscious cognitive organisms experience as “reality.” Since that reality is created almost entirely without the experiencer’s awareness of his or her creative activity, it comes to appear as given by an independently “existing” world. Once knowing is no longer understood as the search for an iconic representation of ontological reality but, instead, as a search for fitting ways of behaving and thinking, the traditional problem of epistemology disappears. Knowledge can now be seen as something which the organism builds up in the attempt to order the as such amorphous flow of experience by establishing repeatable experiences and relatively reliable relations between them. The possibilities of constructing such an order are determined and perpetually constrained by the preceding steps in the construction. That means that the “real” world manifests itself exclusively where our constructions break down. Moreover, we can describe and explain these breakdowns only in the very concepts that we have used to build the failing structures.",Psychology,4,0,experiencing consciousness creates structure flow experience structure conscious cognitive organism experience reality since reality created almost entirely without experiencers awareness creative activity come appear given independently existing world knowing longer understood search iconic representation ontological reality instead search fitting way behaving thinking traditional problem epistemology disappears knowledge seen something organism build attempt order amorphous flow experience establishing repeatable experience relatively reliable relation possibility constructing order determined perpetually constrained preceding step construction mean real world manifest exclusively construction break moreover describe explain breakdown concept used build failing structure

I demonstrate that what forensic psychologists refer to as a “cognitive distortion” or “thinking error” is often embedded within a broader narrative, and that these narratives reveal the existence of identifiable strategies designed to communicate something salient, enduring, and moral about the offender. Through the examination of narratives offered by imprisoned sexual offenders, several such narrative strategies containing the seeds of moral agency are identified. It is suggested that CBT's current focus on cognitive distortions effectively eliminates this narrative context and thus serves to disguise and even eradicate the positive, moral notions of self that most offenders exhibit in some form or another. A rehabilitative approach that works with narrative, facilitating development of shared narratives among offenders and therapists, would allow for the emergence of a plan for morally agentive living, transcending what is currently possible within the hostile, challenging framework of CBT.

Imprecision and vagueness hamper comparisons between series. In childhood psychoses some investigators have excluded those cases in which there was any history or clinical evidence of organic features in an attempt to obtain a ‘pure’ group.

Yet throughout these large-scale renovations of scientific practice, scarce attention is given to philosophical and theoretical commitments as potential factors in the crisis problems. Analysis of involved psychologists’ understandings of scientific crisis, replication, and epistemology indicates the need for philosophical examinations. Likewise warranting close analyses are the associated assumptions about objectivity, credibility, and ontology (the nature of psychological phenomena). Such lacuna in the crisis interrogations constitute opportunities for researchers with expertise in the philosophy and theory of psychology to contribute to the science’s immediate problems and collaborate more closely with experimental psychologists.",Psychology,4,0,psychology experiencing many deem crisis often called replication crisis response impressive speed technical change introduced remedy perceived problem data analysis researcher bias publication practice yet throughout largescale renovation scientific practice scarce attention given philosophical theoretical commitment potential factor crisis problem analysis involved psychologist understanding scientific crisis replication epistemology indicates need philosophical examination likewise warranting close analysis associated assumption objectivity credibility ontology nature psychological phenomenon lacuna crisis interrogation constitute opportunity researcher expertise philosophy theory psychology contribute science immediate problem collaborate closely experimental psychologist

They are defined exclusively by their occurrence close to delivery. Attempts to further diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychoses have been prevented to date by the influence of Kraepelin’s dichotomy. New possibilities of nosological differentiation arose out of Kasanin’s (1933) description of schizoaffective psychoses and out of Leonhard’s differentiated nosology (1986). The objective of the present, retrospective study was to apply Leonhard’s nosology to 42 postpartal psychoses. Five diagnostic groups could be identified: 6 cases of manic-depressive disorder, 7 cases of pure depression, 8 cases of pure melancholia, 2 cases of unsystematic schizophrenia, and 19 cases of cycloid psychoses. For this reason we consider that the concept of the cycloid psychoses is appropriate for the characterization of a large proportion of childbed psychoses.",Psychology,3,0,puerperal psychosis traditionally considered nosologically unspecific defined exclusively occurrence close delivery attempt diagnostically subdivide puerperal psychosis prevented date influence kraepelins dichotomy new possibility nosological differentiation arose kasanins description schizoaffective psychosis leonhards differentiated nosology objective present retrospective study apply leonhards nosology postpartal psychosis five diagnostic group could identified case manicdepressive disorder case pure depression case pure melancholia case unsystematic schizophrenia case cycloid psychosis reason consider concept cycloid psychosis appropriate characterization large proportion childbed psychosis

Different groups of sources are explored: philological and antiquarian writings, pedagogical treatises, debates on the respective merits of the liberal and mechanical arts, essays on cryptography and the art of gestures, polemical pamphlets on university reform, universal language scheme, and philosophical analyses of the conduct of the understanding. In the late 17th-century the philosophy of mind discards both the correspondence of predicamental series to reality and the archetypal metaphysics underpinning it. This is a turning point in semantic theory: language is conceived as the social construction of historical-conventional objects through signs and the study of strategies we use to bridge the gap between the privacy of experience and the publicness of speech emerges as one of the main topics in the philosophy of language.",Psychology,4,0,focus volume crisis traditional view relationship word thing emergence linguistic arbitrarism thcentury british philosophy different group source explored philological antiquarian writing pedagogical treatise debate respective merit liberal mechanical art essay cryptography art gesture polemical pamphlet university reform universal language scheme philosophical analysis conduct understanding late thcentury philosophy mind discard correspondence predicamental series reality archetypal metaphysics underpinning turning point semantic theory language conceived social construction historicalconventional object sign study strategy use bridge gap privacy experience publicness speech emerges one main topic philosophy language

In this context it makes sense to consider that the notion of scientific reduction is linked to a classic scientific conception of nature. I argue that if properly understood, the proposal to rethink the concept of nature itself, in enactivist phenomenological approaches, undermines the reductionist program and redefines what it means for phenomenology to be naturalized.",Psychology,1,0,abstract resistance idea phenomenology relevant cognitive scientific explanation faced two objection advanced respectively side issue scientific perspective suggested phenomenology understood account firstperson experience ultimately reducible cognitive neuroscientific explanation phenomenological perspective argued phenomenology naturalized context make sense consider notion scientific reduction linked classic scientific conception nature argue properly understood proposal rethink concept nature enactivist phenomenological approach undermines reductionist program redefines mean phenomenology naturalized

1789,18d969cfc20de7bff922dd61073c57f192b11d03,An Ecological Approach to Psychology,"Even though the term “ecology” was introduced into scientific discourse in the 1860s, and by century's end much of experimental psychology had embraced an evolutionary perspective, it took more than another half century before proposals for an ecological psychology began to appear. Even so, ecological psychology was marginalized from the mainstream of the discipline, and it remains so today. This disjunction between psychology's embrace of evolutionary theory and its resistance to ecological thinking can be explained, in large part, historically. It was Herbert Spencer's evolutionary framework, that assumes an environment-mind dichotomy, which was embraced by most early psychologists, and its influence remains today. A Darwinian perspective, in contrast, stresses the activity of an organism in the context of the dynamic mutual relations of its econiche. At the heart of Darwinian thinking, and in turn ecological psychology, are dynamic organism-environment relations, functionally meaningful environmental properties, as well as change and variation. An ecological psychology also recognizes that humans, like other living things, adapt to their econiche, in part, by altering it and thereby modifying the econiche's functional properties. The human econiche, in particular, is characterized by functionally significant, socially normative meanings owing to the sociocultural systems that naturally stem from the character of hominid evolution.",Psychology,5,0,even though term ecology introduced scientific discourse century end much experimental psychology embraced evolutionary perspective took another half century proposal ecological psychology began appear even ecological psychology marginalized mainstream discipline remains today disjunction psychology embrace evolutionary theory resistance ecological thinking explained large part historically herbert spencer evolutionary framework assumes environmentmind dichotomy embraced early psychologist influence remains today darwinian perspective contrast stress activity organism context dynamic mutual relation econiche heart darwinian thinking turn ecological psychology dynamic organismenvironment relation functionally meaningful environmental property well change variation ecological psychology also recognizes human like living thing adapt econiche part altering thereby modifying econiches functional property human econiche particular characterized functionally significant socially normative meaning owing sociocultural system naturally stem character hominid evolution
1790,e5e95b7222ac9b50308c82a6b95ac8fd9ef188ee,Phenomenology as a Form of Empathy,"Abstract This paper proposes that adopting a “phenomenological stance” enables a distinctive kind of empathy, which is required in order to understand forms of experience that occur in psychiatric illness and elsewhere. For the most part, we interpret other people's experiences against the backdrop of a shared world. Hence our attempts to appreciate interpersonal differences do not call into question a deeper level of commonality. A phenomenological stance involves suspending our habitual acceptance of that world. It thus allows us to contemplate the possibility of structurally different ways of “finding oneself in the world”. Such a stance, I suggest, can be incorporated into an empathetic appreciation of others' experiences, amounting to what we might call “radical empathy”.",Psychology,1,0,abstract paper proposes adopting phenomenological stance enables distinctive kind empathy required order understand form experience occur psychiatric illness elsewhere part interpret people experience backdrop shared world hence attempt appreciate interpersonal difference call question deeper level commonality phenomenological stance involves suspending habitual acceptance world thus allows u contemplate possibility structurally different way finding oneself world stance suggest incorporated empathetic appreciation others experience amounting might call radical empathy
1791,3d964a81bea8365744570666404ddbacaed25012,"The Chinese Heart in a Cognitive Perspective: Culture, Body, and Language","This book is a cognitive semantic study of the Chinese conceptualization of the heart, traditionally seen as the central faculty of cognition. The Chinese word xin, which primarily denotes the heart organ, covers the meanings of both ""heart"" and ""mind"" as understood in English, which upholds a heart-head dichotomy. In contrast to the Western dualist view, Chinese takes on a more holistic view that sees the heart as the center of both emotions and thought. The contrast characterizes two cultural traditions that have developed different conceptualizations of person, self, and agent of cognition. The concept of ""heart"" lies at the core of Chinese thought and medicine, and its importance to Chinese culture is extensively manifested in the Chinese language. Diachronically, this book traces the roots of its conception in ancient Chinese philosophy and traditional Chinese medicine. Along the synchronic dimension, it not only makes a systematic analysis of conventionalized expressions that reflect the underlying cultural models and conceptualizations, as well as underlying conceptual metaphors and metonymies, but also attempts a textual analysis of an essay and a number of poems for their metaphoric and metonymic images and imports contributing to the cultural models and conceptualizations. It also takes up a comparative perspective that sheds light on similarities and differences between Western and Chinese cultures in the understanding of the heart, brain, body, mind, self, and person. The book contributes to the understanding of the embodied nature of human cognition situated in its cultural context, and the relationship between language, culture, and cognition.",Psychology,4,0,book cognitive semantic study chinese conceptualization heart traditionally seen central faculty cognition chinese word xin primarily denotes heart organ cover meaning heart mind understood english upholds hearthead dichotomy contrast western dualist view chinese take holistic view see heart center emotion thought contrast characterizes two cultural tradition developed different conceptualization person self agent cognition concept heart lie core chinese thought medicine importance chinese culture extensively manifested chinese language diachronically book trace root conception ancient chinese philosophy traditional chinese medicine along synchronic dimension make systematic analysis conventionalized expression reflect underlying cultural model conceptualization well underlying conceptual metaphor metonymy also attempt textual analysis essay number poem metaphoric metonymic image import contributing cultural model conceptualization also take comparative perspective shed light similarity difference western chinese culture understanding heart brain body mind self person book contributes understanding embodied nature human cognition situated cultural context relationship language culture cognition
1792,3ece4ab9b51b22105e654e2c587d2c4fbd19f59d,A triangular theory of love.,"This article presents a triangular theory of love. According to the theory, love has three components: (a) intimacy, which encompasses the feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness one experiences in loving relationships; (b) passion, which encompasses the drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, and sexual consummation; and (c) decision/commitment, which encompasses, in the short term, the decision that one loves another, and in the long term, the commitment to maintain that love. The amount of love one experiences depends on the absolute strength of these three components, and the kind of love one experiences depends on their strengths relative to each other. The three components interact with each other and with the actions that they produce and that produce them so as to form a number of different kinds of loving experiences. The triangular theory of love subsumes certain other theories and can account for a number of empirical findings in the research literature, as well as for a number of experiences with which many are familiar firsthand. It is proposed that the triangular theory provides a rather comprehensive basis for understanding many aspects of the love that underlies close relationships. What does it mean ""to love"" someone? Does it always mean the same thing, and if not, in what ways do loves differ from each other? Why do certain loves seem to last, whereas others disappear almost as quickly as they are formed? This article seeks to answer these and other questions through a triangular theory of love. This tripartite theory deals both with the nature of love and with loves in various kinds of relationships. The presentation of the theory will be divided into three main parts. In the first part, the main tenets of the theory will be explained and discussed, and the theory will be compared with other theories of love. In the second part, the implications of the theory for close relationships and satisfaction in them will be described. In the third part, the theory will be shown to account for many of the empirical phenomena that have been observed with regard to love.",Psychology,4,0,article present triangular theory love according theory love three component intimacy encompasses feeling closeness connectedness bondedness one experience loving relationship b passion encompasses drive lead romance physical attraction sexual consummation c decisioncommitment encompasses short term decision one love another long term commitment maintain love amount love one experience depends absolute strength three component kind love one experience depends strength relative three component interact action produce produce form number different kind loving experience triangular theory love subsumes certain theory account number empirical finding research literature well number experience many familiar firsthand proposed triangular theory provides rather comprehensive basis understanding many aspect love underlies close relationship mean love someone always mean thing way love differ certain love seem last whereas others disappear almost quickly formed article seek answer question triangular theory love tripartite theory deal nature love love various kind relationship presentation theory divided three main part first part main tenet theory explained discussed theory compared theory love second part implication theory close relationship satisfaction described third part theory shown account many empirical phenomenon observed regard love

Alternative epistemologies offered by post-modernist, feminist, and anti-racist theory suggest a different conceptual underpinning for APEL.

Beginning with the assumption that human self-awareness involves a set of distinct cognitive abilities that evolved at different times to solve different adaptive problems, we trace the evolution of self-awareness from the common ancestor of humans and apes to the beginnings of culture, drawing upon paleontological, anthropological, biological, and psychological evidence. These data converge to suggest that that modern self-thought appeared just prior to the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition, approximately 60,000 years ago.Recto running head: Evolution of the Self.",Psychology,5,0,previous discussion evolution self diverged greatly estimate date capacity selfthought emerged factor led selfreflection evolve nature evidence offered support disparate conclusion beginning assumption human selfawareness involves set distinct cognitive ability evolved different time solve different adaptive problem trace evolution selfawareness common ancestor human ape beginning culture drawing upon paleontological anthropological biological psychological evidence data converge suggest modern selfthought appeared prior middleupper paleolithic transition approximately year agorecto running head evolution self
